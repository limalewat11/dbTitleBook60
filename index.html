Perfect for new parents, baby showers, christenings, and sharing at bedtime.</b><i><br><br>I am your parent; you are my child.<br>I am your quiet place; you are my wild.<p>I am your favorite book; you are my new lines.<br>I am your nightlight; you are my starshine.</p></i><p>A day in the life of parent and child--full of smiles and giggles, messes and meals, boundless energy and well-earned rest. Not to mention lots of love. Here, in simple rhyming verse accompanied by colorful, playful illustrations by world-renowed artist Satomi Ichikawa, is one such day. Share it with others and treasure the memories.</p></p><p>Satomi Ichikawa, creator of the Nora books, lives in Paris, France.Even Ichikawa's (the Tanya series) effervescent watercolors can't disguise a rhyming text that is as corny as Kansas in August. The simile-driven format is established on the very first page: "I am your parent; you are my child. I am your quiet place; you are my wild." As the sage teddy bear and the adorable child make their way through the day, the elder bear is always described in terms of wisdom and patience, while the offspring is ebullient and unpredictable (the characters' genders aren't specified). First-time author Cusimano stretches the conceit past the breaking point: for bathtime, she writes, "I am your dry towel; you are my wet bath." At the evening meal, it's "I am your dinner; you are my chocolate cake. I am your bedtime; you are my wide awake." Fortunately, Ichikawa's graceful, full-bleed pictures have none of the text's saccharine qualities. Her views of the teddy bear duo have a sweet, simple pellucidity, instantly communicating all that the reader needs to know about the wonders of loving and being loved. Ages 3-7. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Breaking Intimidation</h2><p><p> Countless Christians battle intimidation, which is camouflaged and subtle.

Bevere advises, "Walk in your own God-given authority, or someone else will take it from you and use it against you."</p> <br></p><p><p>John Bevere is passionate to see individuals deepen their intimacy with God and capture eternal perspective.

But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave. </p><p>This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.</p><p>Shel Silverstein's very first children's book <i>Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back </i>was published in 1963, and followed the next year by two other books. The first of those, <i>The Giving Tree,</i> is a moving story about the love of a tree for a boy; it took four years before Harper Children's books decided to publish it. Shel returned to humour that same year with<i>A Giraffe and a Half.</i> His first collection of poems and drawings, <i>Where the Sidewalk Ends,</i> appeared in 1974, and his second, <i>A Light in the Attic,</i> in 1981<i>.</i> When he was a G.I. in Japan and Korea in the 1950, he learned to play the guitar and to write songs, including 'A Boy Named Sue' for Johnny Cash. In 1984, Silverstein won a Grammy Award for Best Children's Album for <i>Where the Sidewalk Ends</i> - 'recited, sung and shouted' by the author. He was also an accomplished playwright, including the 1981 hit, 'The Lady or the Tiger Show.' The last book to be published before he died in 1999, was <i>Falling Up</i> (1996).</p></p><p>To say that this particular apple tree is a "giving tree" is an understatement. In Shel Silverstein's popular tale of few words and simple line drawings, a tree starts out as a leafy playground, shade provider, and apple bearer for a rambunctious little boy. Making the boy happy makes the tree happy, but with time it becomes more challenging for the generous tree to meet his needs. When he asks for money, she suggests that he sell her apples. When he asks for a house, she offers her branches for lumber. When the boy is old, too old and sad to play in the tree, he asks the tree for a boat. She suggests that he cut her down to a stump so he can craft a boat out of her trunk. He unthinkingly does it. At this point in the story, the double-page spread shows a pathetic solitary stump, poignantly cut down to the heart the boy once carved into the tree as a child that said "M.E. + T." "And then the tree was happy... but not really." When there's nothing left of her, the boy returns again as an old man, needing a quiet place to sit and rest. The stump offers up her services, and he sits on it. "And the tree was happy." While the message of this book is unclear (Take and take and take? Give and give and give? Complete self-sacrifice is good? Complete self-sacrifice is infinitely sad?), Silverstein has perhaps deliberately left the book open to interpretation.

Yorick Brown and his capuchin monkey, Ampersand, are the lone male survivors of a planet-wide "gendercide." The loss of 48 percent of the population has thrown much of the planet into chaos, creating dangerous conditions for everyone&#x2013;especially the only man alive. Yorick makes his way to San Francisco, to Dr. Mann, who is trying to find the cause and cure for the male plague. Agent 355 shadows him and protects him from a variety of spies, fanatics, criminals, and nuts who would stand in his way. When Ampersand is kidnapped and whisked off to Japan, they must take to the seas to try and find him. The artwork is stunning, featuring the original strips and cover work. Muted tones and changing palettes are expertly used to convey mood and tone. The highly original plot is compelling and fast moving, with plenty of action. The use of flashbacks, hallucinations, and fantasies within the story line may confuse weaker readers. Most teens will want to read the previous volumes first. Harsh language, adult situations, and occasional partial nudity make this one most appropriate for public libraries.<i>Anthony C. Doyle, Livingston High School, CA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Nor is it always easy to raise, care for, guide and teach a highly sensitive child. Because the highly sensitive child experiences the world a little differently, and that can be difficult to understand. This book aims to help you experience the world from the child&#x2019;s perspective, so that you can better understand them and help them to grow and thrive. In this simple, concise guide I distil the reams of information available on the highly sensitive child so that you can get the knowledge you need quickly and easily. Foreword from Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D. author of the worldwide bestsellers The Highly Sensitive Person and The Highly Sensitive Child: "As the author of this truly brilliant little book, Jamie Williamson explains that he is not an academic or a psychologist. I am simply a man who feels very passionately about the subject. He is highly sensitive and so is one of his daughters, and he writes about sensitivity with both simplicity and depth. His sensitivity also shows in his book&#x2019;s briefness. Caregivers of children need an author to get to the point so they can go get groceries, pick up the kids etc. Jamie&#x2019;s book can be read in an hour, yet it has charming examples as well as great suggestions and a full, scientifically accurate description of the trait. Jamie is reaching out to all parents, carers and teachers of sensitive children and whether through this book or on his website, he is a wonderful resource."</p><p>A little about me...... I&#39;m not an academic. I&#39;m not a psychologist. I&#39;m simply a man who is very, very passionate about the subject because: I have a highly sensitive daughter. High sensitivity has a massive impact on my family&#39;s life, and coming to understand the trait has transformed our lives - for the better. Before we understood high sensitivity we were bumbling about in the dark; now we&#39;re in the light.</p><h2>On the Threshold of Hope: Opening the Door to Healing for Survivors of Sexual Abuse (AACC Counseling Library)</h2><p><i>On the Threshold of Hope</i> offers hope and healing to men and women who have been traumatized by sexual abuse. Dr. Langberg's insights and the quotations from many survivors assure readers that they are not alone and that Christ, the Redeemer, can heal their deep wounds. Through stories, Scripture, questions, and encouragement, Dr. Langberg walks with survivors on the road to healing through Christ's love and power.</p><p><b>If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, <br>or if someone you love is a survivor, <br>this book will open the door to deep healing.</b><br><br>"I have lost count of the number of survivors who have shared with me how Diane Langberg's <i>On the Threshold of Hope</i> helped them discover that attainable hope. Using her decades of experience as a world-renowned trauma-informed therapist (and amazing listener), my dear friend and mentor Diane Langberg helps readers encounter that hope by understanding the character and person of Jesus, who notices, empathizes with, and loves the vulnerable and wounded." --<b>Boz Tchividjian, </b> <i>attorney, law professor, and founder and executive director of Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment (GRACE)</i><br><br>"Diane's writing has long been a place of safety for sexual assault survivors, myself included. Her ability to bring the beauty of the gospel to the deepest of wounds, with understanding and compassion, has brought hope into darkness. Survivors need her voice. The church, and everyone who walks alongside survivors, needs her expertise. I am deeply grateful for her work." --<b>Rachael Denhollander, </b> <i>attorney, advocate, and author of</i> What Is a Girl Worth?<br><br>"Silenced from abuse to the point of being mute most of my childhood, words were foreign to me. Yet, as Dr. Langberg says, 'Learning to speak the unspeakable must happen in order for healing to occur.' These pages contain the collective voices of survivors crying out with clarity the crushing pain of abuse. These survivors also speak truths they've discovered on this journey--truths that provide space for others to believe that hope and healing are indeed possible. Dr. Langberg's wise unfolding of what healing looks like in <i>On the Threshold of Hope</i> helped me speak the truth about my abuse and begin a life-changing journey toward healing. The same healing is available to you. On the threshold, I have found the Redeemer to be my Door of Hope." --<b>Ami, </b> <i>survivor of sexual abuse</i><br><br><b>Dr. Diane Langberg</b> is globally recognized for her forty-five years of clinical work with trauma victims. She has trained caregivers on six continents in responding to trauma and to the abuse of power. She directs her own counseling practice, is the author of numerous books, and is the coleader of the Global Trauma Recovery Institute housed at Biblical Theological Seminary. She serves on the board of GRACE (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment) and as cochair for the American Bible Society's Trauma Advisory Council.

It&#x2019;s normal for teens to explore a new sense of freedom and to redefine the ways in which they relate to their parents, and that process can sometimes leave parents feeling powerless, alienated, or excluded from their children&#x2019;s lives. These effects can be magnified even further in this modern age of social networks, cell phones, and constant digital distraction. <br><br>This newly revised and updated edition of <i>Positive Discipline for Teenagers</i> shows parents how to build stronger bridges of communication with their children, break the destructive cycles of guilt and blame that occur in parent-teen power struggles, and work toward greater mutual respect with their adolescents. At the core of the Positive Discipline approach is the understanding that teens still need their parents, just in different ways&#x2014;and by better understanding who their teens really are, parents can learn to encourage both their teens and themselves, and instill good judgment without being judgmental. The methods in this book work to build vital social and life skills through encouragement and empowerment&#x2014;not punishment. Truly effective parenting is about <i>connection</i> before <i>correction</i>.<br><br>Over the years, millions of parents have come to trust Jane Nelsen&#x2019;s classic Positive Discipline series for its consistent, commonsense approach to raising happy, responsible kids. This new edition is filled with proven, effective methods for coping with such parenting challenges as:<br>&nbsp;<br>-Fostering truly <i>honest</i> discussions with your teen<br>-Helping your teen handle the online world&nbsp; <br>-Turning mistakes into opportunities<br>-Keeping your sanity while raising your teen&#x2014;and making sure your own teenage issues aren&#x2019;t weighing you down<br>-Teaching your teen how to pursue the goal that make <i>them</i> happy...and a few that make <i>you</i> happy too (like chores)<br>-Making sure you&#x2019;re on your teen&#x2019;s side, and that <i>they </i>know that<br>-Avoiding the pitfalls of excessive control and excessive permissiveness</p><p><b>JANE NELSEN, Ed.D</b>, coauthor of the bestselling Positive Discipline series, is a licensed marriage, family, and child therapist and an internationally known speaker.<br><br><b>LYNN LOTT, M.A., M.F.T.</b>, is a therapist and author of more than 18 books and manuals including four in the Positive Discipline series.How Do You Know When Your Child Becomes a Teen?<br><br>When Your Child No Longer Thinks You Hang the Stars<br><br>When Sally became a teenager, her mother thought Sally had become a different person. She dressed differently, had different friends, became a rock fan, and started playing the guitar. Underneath, she was still Sally, but now she had taken on a new role: Sally &#x201c;the rocker.&#x201d; A friend asked Sally&#x2019;s mother, &#x201c;When Sally was little, was she interested in superheroes? Did she ask you to sew a &#x2018;W&#x2019; on her leotard so she could pretend to be Wonder Woman? Did you think it was cute?&#x201d; Mom smiled as she remembered how cute she thought Sally was at this stage of her life. Her friend continued, &#x201c;Could you think of her that way now? Imagine that she&#x2019;s put on the suit of a rocker. That&#x2019;s what is going on; she&#x2019;s trying on an identity, but the identity is not who Sally �really is.&#x201d;<br><br>It may help to remember how different your personality is now from the way you were as a teen. Even though living with your adolescent child may seem to last forever, adolescence is just a brief part of the growing process. It is by no means the final destination.<br><br>The Dream Teen and the Normal Teen<br><br>In our workshops on parenting teenagers, we challenge preconceived notions about teens through an activity called &#x201c;Draw a Teen&#x201d; (from the manual: Teaching Parenting the Positive Discipline Way by Lynn Lott and Jane Nelsen, 6th edition, 2008). We form two groups. One group is asked to draw a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; �teen&#x2014;�how most parents see their teens. We invite them to exaggerate. The composite teen is �self-�centered, listens to loud music, defies authority, prefers friends to family, has a messy room decorated with posters, values cars and an independent lifestyle, conforms to the clothing styles of peers (no matter how gross), is wearing earphones and is playing video games, smokes, and drinks alcohol. Comments from the group include:<br><br>&#x201c;Well, this is an exaggeration. All teens �aren&#x2019;t like this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it sure does depict the rebelliousness because most of them are a lot like this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It helps to be reminded that my teen would not be normal if he cleaned his room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come to think about it, I was like that once.&#x201d;<br><br>This last comment was a nice reminder to the group that we all continue to grow and change beyond adolescence.<br><br>The other group is asked to draw a &#x201c;dream&#x201d; teen, or how most parents think they want their teens to be. This composite teen is voted prom queen or king, keeps agreements (&#x201c;I promise to be there on time, as always&#x201d;), volunteers to help, loves to talk to parents (&#x201c;Let me tell you everything about my life&#x201d;), eats only healthy food, �doesn&#x2019;t watch television, is very athletic, earns two scholarships (one athletic and one academic), scores high on the SATs, lines up a summer job by January, supplies his or her own money for hair or makeup and saves the rest for college and a car, respects everyone (including siblings), is respectfully assertive, �doesn&#x2019;t waste time on video games, and is an A student. Comments from the group include:<br><br>&#x201c;A teen like this �wouldn&#x2019;t have any friends. No one could stand him or her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have friends who have a teen like this and I can&#x2019;t stand her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My teen is like this, although she seems pretty stressed most of the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can see that I expect my teen to be perfect, even though I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know a few teens like this and I think they&#x2019;re terrific.&#x201d;<br><br>Parents often see the dream teen as the &#x201c;good kid.&#x201d; You may not have thought about this, but these teens may have sold out to become pleasers and approval junkies. Their parents use them as the standard and say to siblings, &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you be more like your brother or sister? At least I have one that �doesn&#x2019;t give me any trouble.&#x201d; The &#x201c;good kid&#x201d; may feel significant only if he or she is getting this kind of praise. Many teens like this fall apart when they make their first big mistake. Some cannot handle the competition when they get to college and discover they are not the only special student. Unable to handle this pressure, some even commit suicide because they don&#x2019;t think they can stay on top. Others start their individuation very late, sometimes wasting their freshman year in college partying instead of studying now that they are not feeling pressured by their parents.<br><br>What all teens are trying to figure out is, &#x201c;Who am I, and am I good enough?&#x201d; That journey can look very different from the outside, depending on the teen. Don&#x2019;t be fooled by appearances. It&#x2019;s pretty tough to go through adolescence without some insecurity. Keep in mind that if you fantasize about having a dream teen, that kid might be struggling with issues of perfectionism.<br><br>Your Feelings Let You Know When Your Child Has Become a Teen<br><br>Most dramatic changes with your kids are accompanied by a feeling response from you. Think how excited you were when your kids were potty trained. Remember how you felt when your kid said &#x201c;NO&#x201d; to everything you asked. Flash back to your feelings when your kids started school or had their first overnight at a friend&#x2019;s house. Now think about some of the feelings you&#x2019;ve had as your kids have evolved into adolescence. Can you match the shock and/or stress experienced by the following parents?<br><br>Herb recalled the day he inadvertently discovered his �eleven-�year-�old daughter, Kim, had sent 210 text messages in less than a day to a boy in her class. Most of the texts referred to how much they liked each other and that they wanted to kiss each other. �Herb&#x2019;s other daughter, �fifteen-�year-�old Macy, had no interest in boys or even texting, so it took him by surprise to realize that his �eleven-�year-�old daughter had become a teen.<br><br>Maxine took her stepson shopping for a new winter jacket. When the sales clerk put the jacket in a shopping bag, her stepson walked away and started heading out of the store, leaving the bag on the counter. Maxine grabbed the bag, irritated that her stepson was acting so unappreciative. When she met him at the car, she asked him what was going on. He said, &#x201c;I �wasn&#x2019;t going to have anyone see me carrying a shopping bag through the mall. �That&#x2019;s lame.&#x201d; Maxine �didn&#x2019;t know whether she wanted to hug him or shoot him.<br><br>Sandi remembered the shock she felt when her nephew, who never noticed if his socks matched or his hair was combed, showed up in pants hanging below his waist, tennis shoes without laces, and a head full of mousse. He had mastered the latest &#x201c;teen&#x201d; look.<br><br>Pete told his friend, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know �what&#x2019;s going on with my �thirteen-� year-�old son, Trevor. One minute he&#x2019;s my best friend and the next he&#x2019;s yelling at me and treating me like the enemy. I&#x2019;m starting to come down hard on him so he �doesn&#x2019;t think he can get away with that lousy behavior. I can&#x2019;t remember when I&#x2019;ve felt so angry.&#x201d; �Pete&#x2019;s friend �couldn&#x2019;t help laughing. &#x201c;Pete,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;welcome to the world of teenagers. You&#x2019;ve been anointed.&#x201d;<br><br>Anointment to Teen Parenting Can Be Stressful<br><br>Stress is the space between your thoughts of how life should be and how life �really is. This definition of stress (although different from what you may have heard) can be very helpful. Since stress is created by your thoughts, you can feel less stressed by becoming aware of the thoughts and looking either for ways to change how life is or what you think it should be. This method can be done without deep breathing (though it won&#x2019;t hurt you to take a few deep breaths) or jogging (though we encourage exercise of all kinds) or taking pills or having a drink (�really). In the following activity, we&#x2019;ll show you how easy it can be to reduce stress.<br><br>Grab a sheet of paper. At the top of the paper, start by writing down your view of how you think it should be with your teen. Now write down how it is across the bottom of the paper. Look at the space between the top and the bottom of the paper, and in large letters that fill all the space, write the word &#x201c;STRESS.&#x201d; Stress is represented by the space between how life should be (according to you) and how life is.<br><br>At this point you can see why you&#x2019;re feeling so �stressed&#x2014;�there&#x2019;s probably a big gap between the two. Now think about what you do when you&#x2019;re stressed. Jot it down on your paper somewhere in the middle of the sheet. What you&#x2019;re writing down are your coping behaviors for dealing with stress. If you look closely, your coping behaviors could be increasing your stress.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s the tricky part. It&#x2019;s called &#x201c;paper folding.&#x201d; Your job is to fold the bottom of the paper to meet the top of the paper so that both lines you wrote are now next to each other. (Parents, you may need to ask your teens to do this for you.) As you look at the two lines close together without the stress in between, what are you thinking, feeling, and deciding?<br><br>Aimee tried this activity. At the top she wrote, &#x201c;It drives me crazy when my son procrastinates and waits until the last minute to get his homework done. I hate nagging him all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>At the bottom she wrote, &#x201c;No matter what I do, he just gets angry and procrastinates more. The frustrating thing is that he usually gets his assignments done, but he creates so much stress for himself and for me.&#x201d;<br><br>Aimee shared that the big gap between the top of the paper and the bottom was a good representation of her stress. The way she handled the stress was to feel angry and obsess about, &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t he just do what he is supposed to do?&#x201d; Then she interrupts whatever he is doing and bugs him to get his assignments done. She threatens him with loss of privileges and feels angry when it �doesn&#x2019;t work. Then she thinks of herself as a failure as a mom because she can&#x2019;t change him.<br><br>When she folded the paper so the lines were next to each other without the big gap, she said, &#x201c;What a waste. All my anger and nagging �doesn&#x2019;t change a thing. I wonder what would happen if I just acknowledged him for pulling his homework out of the hat at the last minute? Would that just reinforce his procrastination? Well, what I&#x2019;m doing isn&#x2019;t changing anything. I can at least give up my stress. And it would be fun to watch the look on his face when I compliment him instead of nagging him.&#x201d;<br><br>This stress activity has helped many parents gain awareness that eliminated (or greatly reduced) their stress. You can also reduce your stress when you understand that who your teens are today is not who they will be forever.<br><br>Who They Are Today Is Not Who They Will Be Forever<br><br>When Mary was a teenager, her mother constantly nagged her about leaving her dirty dishes in her room or in the sink. Now Mary nags her husband about leaving his dirty dishes around the house or in the sink. Brian seemed �self-�centered and selfish as a teen. As an adult he is a social worker who advocates for people in need.<br><br>Think of yourself as a teenager. In what ways are you different as an adult than you were then? Are you more responsible? Do you have more purpose and motivation in life? Are you less selfish? Are you more considerate of others? You might find it helpful to make a list of the dramatic ways you have changed since you were a teenager.<br><br>Although it may seem otherwise, teens have not grown up yet. Their behavior is only temporary. Teens want to explore how they are different from their families, how they feel and what they think about things, and what their own values are. This process of separation from the family is called &#x201c;individuation.&#x201d;<br><br>Teenage individuation can start as early as ten or eleven and as late as eighteen or nineteen. Some people never individuate (other than changing physically), or wait until adulthood to make the big steps described in the following characteristics of individuation, which are discussed in more detail after the list.<br><br>CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUATION<br><br>Adolescents have a need to find out who they are.<br><br>Individuation often looks like rebellion because teens are testing family values.<br><br>Adolescents go through huge physical and emotional changes.<br><br>Peer relationships take precedence over family relationships.<br><br>Teens explore and exercise personal power and autonomy.<br><br>Teens have a great need for privacy from their parents.<br><br>Parents become an embarrassment to their teens.<br><br>Teens see themselves as omnipotent and all knowing.<br><br>Keep in mind that these characteristics occur on a continuum from hardly at all to almost all the time. Teenage development can look very different from teen to teen.<br><br>Adolescents Have a Need to Find Out Who They Are<br><br>You know that your children are individuating when they start keeping secrets from you. Do you remember your own teen secrets? When we ask parents to do an activity called &#x201c;Teen Secrets&#x201d; (What did you do as a teen that you �didn&#x2019;t want your parents to know about?), there is a lot of laughter as they share their stories about sneaking out at night, experimenting with drugs and alcohol, sex in the backseats of cars, tipping over cows, and pranks that would warrant jail sentences today. These parents are CEOs of companies, teachers, principals, mechanics, doctors, plumbers, fathers, and mothers who are scared that their children are doing what they did as teens.<br><br>Individuation often Looks Like Rebellion<br><br>Although most parents worry when their teenagers rebel, it would be more appropriate to worry if they �didn&#x2019;t. Teenagers must begin their separation from their families, and rebellion gives them the ability to do this. At first, teens may rebel by challenging what is important to their families (family values) or zeroing in on what their parents want and then doing exactly the opposite. Later, they may rebel in other �ways&#x2014;�but at first individuation is primarily a reaction against their parents, and doing the opposite is the simplest, most natural way of being different. If teens are not allowed to rebel, they may do it in their twenties, thirties, or fifties. Teens who don&#x2019;t rebel (individuate) may become approval �junkies&#x2014;�afraid to take risks or to feel comfortable with who they are.<br><br>When teens can go through their process of individuation in a supportive atmosphere (see Chapter 9), they are more likely to readopt family values in their twenties. The more they encounter disrespectful judgment, punishment, and control, the more likely they will get &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; in their individuation process, and the less likely it is that they will come back to family values.</p><h2>Masterwork Classics: Level 3, Book &amp; CD</h2><p>A progressive repertoire series designed to motivate students while allowing them to progress evenly and smoothly from the earliest classics toward intermediate literature.

In this expanded version of the favorite nursery rhyme, Iza Trapani takes the earliest readers on a journey across the night sky. With playful verse and bright illustrations Iza Trapani introduces us to our irresistible young heroine as she wishes upon a mischievous, twinkling star. Granting her wish, the little star takes her on a dazzling and daring trip among swirling planets and beaming stars for one magical night. This new spin on the much-loved classic is a wonderful gift for even the littlest stargazers.</p><p>Iza Trapani is the best-selling author/illustrator of several children&#39;s books, including TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR; I&#39;M A LITTLE TEAPOT; THE ITSY BITSY SPIDER; and RUFUS AND FRIENDS: RHYME TIME. She lives in the Hudson Valley of New York.PreSchool-Grade 2?A little blonde girl gazes out of her window at a twinkling celestial object, greets it with the traditional childhood rhyme of the title, and requests that she might have her wish that night. Her wish comes true when the smiling star appears in her window and takes her on a magical ride through the sky. The combination of serene, lovely landscapes and a cartoon, smiley-faced star has a hodgepodge effect. The rhyming text, while serviceable, switches voice from the girl to the star with no punctuational differentiation, resulting in some confusion when reading aloud. Musical notation is included, which will make this useful as a lullaby, but it is a disappointing, overly sweet and contrived follow-up to Trapani's clever Itsy Bitsy Spider (Whispering Coyote, 1993).?Anna DeWind, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Barefoot Books Bear on a Bike</h2><p>Bear on a Bike transports young readers around the world by bike, train, raft, boat and even hot-air balloon, with a special night-time journey at the end. As you cycle through the market, sail to an island and fly over the rainbow, you will discover marvellous creatures and see many wondrous sights.</p><p>Stella Blackstone (Bath) has written many best-selling books for Barefoot Books, including the highly successful Bear series. She lives in the Cotswolds with her three children. Debbie Harter (London) illustrated the popular Bear series and The Animal Boogie, which won an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Seal, 2001, (a U.S. award given to outstanding new products that enhance the lives of children), and the delightful Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon and Cooking with Herb. She lives in North London.PreSchool-Grade 1-A bear takes off to see the world on a variety of vehicles: a bicycle, a raft, a covered wagon, a steam train, a sailboat, a hot-air balloon, a carriage, and a rocket. As each mode of transportation is introduced, a young African-American boy calls out, "Where are you going, bear?/Please wait for me!" The bear takes the child along on his journeys where he discovers exciting animals, people, and places. As the bear blasts off in the rocket, the boy remains behind and calls out, "Wherever you are going, bear,/Goodbye and goodnight!" Despite several awkward rhythms, the story works as a read-aloud. The strength of this book, however, lies in Harter's flat, colorful cartoon art. Black-and-white accents in the cheery, sun-drenched landscapes unite the illustrations and add balance. The bear is depicted as a friendly, caramel-brown creature who comfortably walks through a multicultural world of interesting, jolly people. The playful pictures extend to the endpapers where the various modes of transportation glide across a turquoise background.<br><i>Shawn Brommer, Southern Tier Library System, Painted Post, NY</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Goblin Slayer, Vol. 3 (manga) (Goblin Slayer (manga), 3)</h2><p>Goblin Slayer recuperates from his fight with the ogre, but then he discovers a goblin horde is going to attack Cow Girl's village--that day!!

In these "beloved stories, morsels rich with the gritty essence of Africa," we meet, among many others, a Kenyan lion named Simba, a snake with seven heads and a trickster from Zulu folklore; we hear the voices of the scheming hyena and learn from a Khoi fable how animals acquired their tails and horns. Several creation myths tell us how the land, its animals, and its people all came into existence under a punishing sun or against the backdrop of a spectacularly beautiful mountain landscape. Whether warning children about the dangers of disobedience or demonstrating that the underdog can--and often does--win, these stories, through their depiction of wise animals as well as evil monsters, are "universal in their portrayal of humanity, beasts, and the mystical."<br><br> What is particularly exciting about this book is that many of the stories, in their oral form, are almost as old as Africa itself. Most of them were, in fact, first told in various African tongues around evening fires in centuries past--tales from, for example, the San and the Khoi, the original hunter-gatherers and livestock herders of Southern Africa. Translated into English and other European languages chiefly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from their original languages--be they Karanga, Nguni, Xhosa, or one of many others--these folktales are a testament to the craft of storytelling and the power of myth. Accompanied by dozens of enchanting, specially commissioned color paintings, <em>Favorite African Folktales</em>--culled from African countries as far-flung as Morocco, Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya--presents a fountain of precious knowledge that will be treasured by children, as well as adults, for years to come.</p><p>Nelson Mandela (1918&#x2015;2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist, who served as the first democratically-elected President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.

In Raymond Briggs's charming tale, told with 175 softly hued, artfully composed frames, a little boy makes friends with a snowman. He wakes up on a snowy day, tells his mother he's going outside, then begins a flurry of snowman-building. That night, he can't sleep, so he opens the front door and lo! the snowman has come to life. The amiable yet frosty fellow enjoys his tour of the boy's cozy home; he admires the cat, but is disturbed by the fire. The boy shows him other wonders--the TV and a lamp and running water. Predictably perhaps, he is disturbed by the stove, but likes ice cubes quite a bit. Soon it is the snowman's turn to introduce the boy to <i>his</i> wintry world. They join hands, rise up into the blizzardy air--presumably over Russia and into the Middle East--and then safely back to home sweet home. The boy pops into bed before his parents get up... but when he wakes up the next morning he races outside only to find his new buddy's melted remains, scattered with a few forlorn lumps of coal. Since the book is wordless, you can make up any ending you want... like "Then, in a puff of pink smoke, the snowman recomposed himself and went to live in the boy's garage freezer." Or you could just resign yourself to a peaceful "And that was that." Raymond Briggs's <i>The Snowman</i> won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, and this wintertime classic continues to win the hearts of kids every year.

If a president is assassinated, it nullifies democracy.</p> <p>In a new chapter to the paperback edition of <em>In the President&#x2019;s Secret Service: Behind the Scenes with Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect</em>, I reveal that threats against President Obama have become so disturbing that a secret Presidential Threat Task Force has been created within the FBI to gather, track, and evaluate assassination threats that might be related to domestic or international terrorism.</p> <p>The task force operates within the FBI&#x2019;s National Security Branch. It consists of twenty representatives from pertinent agencies, including agents from the FBI and Secret Service and operatives from the CIA, the NSA, and the Defense Department, as well as analysts.</p> <p>The hardcover edition reported that threats against Obama rose by as much as 400 percent compared with when President Bush was in office. While threats fluctuate, the level continues to be high enough to call for the threat task force.</p> <p>At the same time, the Secret Service, which let party crashers into the White House in November, has been spinelessly acceding to requests of the Obama administration officials for Secret Service protection in instances where there are no threats against them. No one outside of the government has heard of most of these officials, but they have one thing in common: They enjoy being chauffeured free of charge by the Secret Service.</p> <p>This expansion in protection has occurred at the same time that the Secret Service has cut corners because of understaffing and with a management culture that is complacent about potential risks, thus jeopardizing the president&#x2019;s safety.</p> <p>Those Secret Service deficiencies led to Michaele and Tareq Salahi&#x2019;s intrusion at the White House state dinner for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The breach occurred because of a deliberate, conscious decision by uniformed officers to ignore the fact that the Salahis and Carlos Allen, a third intruder, were not on the guest list. Those decisions are an expected consequence of the agency&#x2019;s practice of cutting corners.</p> <p>The corner-cutting also include: not passing crowds through magnetometers or shutting down the devices early at presidential events; cutting back on the size of counter-assault teams and bowing to demands of staff that the teams remain at a great distance from protectees; not keeping up to date with the latest, most powerful firearms used by the FBI and the military; not allowing agents time for regular firearms requalification or physical training, which the Secret Service covers up by asking agents to fill out their own test scores. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, the uniformed officers who decided to wave the Salahis into the state dinner were aware of the corner-cutting and were overwhelmed by the workload. In part because the Secret Service refuses to demand funds for adequate staffing, the attrition rate is as high as 12 percent a year within the Uniformed Division alone.</p> <p>On top of this, the agency bows to political pressure. When agents refused to drive friends of Dick Cheney&#x2019;s daughter Mary to restaurants, she got her detail leader removed. The fact that Secret Service management does not back personnel when they are just doing their jobs had to contribute to the uniformed officers&#x2019; reluctance to turn away guests at the state dinner and thus potentially face repercussions.</p> <p>In recounting what protectees are like behind the scenes, the book describes as well how difficult Jenna and Barbara Bush were with their agents and how Vice President Joe Biden ignores Secret Service advice about his protection. To make the press think he came to work early, Jimmy Carter would walk into the Oval Office at 5 a.m., then nod off to sleep. Lyndon Johnson would order Secret Service agents to drive on crowded sidewalks so he could make an appointment on time. Johnson would urinate in front of the press corps, which included women reporters. He had a &#x201c;stable&#x201d; of women with whom he had sex at the White House and at his ranch. In addition, Vice President Spiro Agnew, a champion of family values, had extramarital affairs while in office.</p> <p>Despite the breaches and corner-cutting, President Obama has said he has complete confidence in the Secret Service, indicating that he sees no need for a change in management. Given the clear warning signs, that is just as reckless as Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s and John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s disregard for security.</p> <p>Lincoln resisted efforts of his friends, the police, and the military to safeguard him. Finally, late in the Civil War, he agreed to allow four Washington police officers to act as his bodyguards, but on the night of his assassination, only one D.C. patrolman, John F. Parker, was guarding him.</p> <p>Instead of remaining on guard outside the president&#x2019;s box at Ford&#x2019;s Theatre on April 14, 1865, Parker went to a nearby saloon for a drink. As a result of Parker&#x2019;s negligence, just after 10 p.m., John Wilkes Booth made his way to Lincoln&#x2019;s box, sneaked in, and shot him in the back of the head. The president died the next morning.</p> <p>Kennedy told Secret Service agents he did not want them to ride on the small running boards at the rear of his limousine in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p> <p>&#x201c;If agents had been allowed on the rear running boards, they would have pushed the president down and jumped on him to protect him before the fatal shot,&#x201d; Charles &#x201c;Chuck&#x201d; Taylor, who was an agent on the Kennedy detail, tells me.</p> <p>In the case of Obama, in the view of many current Secret Service agents interviewed for <em>In the President&#x2019;s Secret Service</em>, the result of the Secret Service&#x2019;s corner-cutting could be a security breach with deadly consequences.</p> <p>While Secret Service agents are brave and dedicated, the agency&#x2019;s management needs to be replaced. On the night of Obama&#x2019;s state dinner, it was a pretty blonde. Tomorrow, it could be an assassin. </p><b>Ronald Kessler</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Secrets of the FBI</i>, <i>In the President's Secret Service</i>, and <i>The CIA at War</i>.

Robert Z. Aliber probes the sequence of four waves of crises that have involved more than forty countries since the early 1980s and shows that implosions of their banking systems do not follow from the decisions of 'bad actors' but instead are symptomatic of a dysfunctional international monetary arrangement. <br><br>With an updated Foreword from Robert M. Solow and a new Afterword from Lord Robert Skidelsky, this seventh edition exemplifies the continued importance of Kindleberger's work and Aliber's ongoing examination of financial crises around the world.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Robert Z.&nbsp;Aliber is Professor Emeritus of International Economics and Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, USA. He was director of the Center for Studies in International Finance; on the research staff for the Committee for Economic Development and Commission on Money and Credit; and senior economic advisor for the Agency for Economic Development, U.S. Department of State. Best-selling publications include The Reconstruction of International Monetary Arrangements (ed., Macmillan, 1986), The Handbook of International Financial Management (ed. Dow Jones Irwin, 1989), and Global Portfolios (co-editor, Business One Irwin, 1991). He is a co-author of Money, Banking, and the Economy (Norton, First Edition, 1981, Fourth Edition 1990), Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Palgrave MacMillan, 5th ed. 2005, 6th ed. 2011), and author of The International Money Game (Palgrave MacMillan, 2001).<br><br>Aliber has consulted to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and to other U.S. government agencies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, testified before committees of the Congress, and lectured extensively in the United States and abroad.<br><br>The late&nbsp;Charles P.&nbsp;Kindleberger was the Ford Professor of Economics at MIT for 33 years and author of over 30 books. He was best known as a financial historian, whom the Economist referred to as 'the master of the genre' on financial crisis. He advanced the study of international finance and helped to devise the Marshall Plan, approved by Congress, for Europe's reconstruction after World War II. During his tenure at MIT, Kindleberger was a consultant to the federal government several times, most often for the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. In 1985, he was president of the American Economic Association. <br><br>Select key publications by Kindleberger include: International Short-Term Capital Movements (Columbia University Press, 1937), The Dollar Shortage (New York: Wiley and MIT Press, 1950), International Economics (Richard D. Irwin, 1953, 1958, 1963, 1968, 1973, (and with Peter H. Lindert) 1978, 1982), Economic Development (McGraw-Hill, 1958, 1965, (and with Bruce Herrick) 1977, 1983), The World In Depression, 1929-1939 (University of California Press, 1973, revised and enlarged, 1986), and Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Palgrave Macmillan, 1978, revised and enlarged, 1989, 3rd ed. 1996, 4th ed. 1996), The Life of an Economist: An Autobiography (Basil Blackwell, 1991).<p>"The turmoil of 2007-8 reminded us only too painfully that financial crises are not confined to distant times and places. This latest edition of Charlie Kindleberger's classic study of man's serial financial follies, updated by Robert Aliber, brings the story right up to the present. A fount of wisdom not only for students of finance and economics, but also for central bankers and financial market practitioners." &#x2013; Professor Sir Charles Bean, The London School of Economics, UK</p><p>"Since its original publication, this has been one of my indispensable books. It served to help me grasp the gravity of financial crises that afflicted my country and guided me, hopefully, to recommend and take better policy decisions. It has also been an essential teaching tool. For example, on 15 September 2008 I asked my students to read at once several chapters so that they could better understand the events that started to unfold that morning. I welcome with enthusiasm this new edition!" - Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Le�n, Director Yale Center for the Study of Globalization; Former President of Mexico</p><p>"Underneath the hilarious anecdotes, the elegant epigrams, and the graceful turns of phrase, Kindleberger is deadly serious. The manner in which humans beings earn their livings is no laughing matter to him, especially when they attempt to do so at the expense of one another. As he so effectively demonstrates, manias, panics, and crashes are the consequence of an economic environment that cultivates cupidity, chicanery, and rapaciousness rather than a devout belief in the Golden Rule." - From the Foreword to the Fourth Edition by Peter L. Bernstein, author of The Power of Gold </p><p>"Alas, both the need for a book such as Manias, Panics and Crashes, and the coverage of its material, keep on increasing, almost exponentially. So much has happened in the last few years that this is now Bob Aliber's book, as much as, perhaps more, than Charles Kindleberger's. Aliber has enhanced the prior high standards that Kindleberger set. This is an easily accessible book, filled with fascinating historical vignettes, and one that everyone from the experts to newcomers to the field should read and would profit greatly by doing so." - Charles Goodhart, London School of Economics, UK</p></p><h2>The Gestational Diabetes Cookbook &amp; Meal Plan: A Balanced Eating Guide for You and Your Baby</h2><p><p><strong>Recipes for managing gestational diabetes&#x2015;good for you and your baby.</strong></p><p>The right diet can be a big help getting through gestational diabetes. <em>The Gestational Diabetes Cookbook &amp; Meal Plan</em> shows you how you can balance your blood sugar while still eating great meals that nourish both you and your baby every single day.</p><p>Take the guesswork out of your diet with an easy-to-follow, 4-week meal plan, filled with helpful meal prep tips so you&#x2019;ll always have food available&#x2015;even when you don&#x2019;t feel up to cooking.

Jacobs, author of <i>Drop Dead Healthy</i> and <i>The Know-It-All</i>, interviews Bruce Feiler about <i>The Secrets of Happy Families</i>.</b></p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong> Congratulations on this book -- it's amazing. I predict that my family's happiness level will rise approximately 63 percent after I incorporate these tips. You say you read tons of parenting books and most were eye-glazingly dull. Why?</p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> First, 63 percent. That&#x2019;s better than our family! As for parenting books, the biggest problem is they&#x2019;re out of fresh ideas. Meanwhile, in every other world &#x2013; from Silicon Valley, to corporate America, to elite peace negotiators, to the U.S. military &#x2013; there are cutting-edge ways to bring groups closer together. I asked what those folks were doing with their families, then tested their ideas out with mine. </p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong>I absolutely love the idea of weekly family meetings. I&#x2019;m going to start holding them this week. Any tips for keeping kids from zoning out?</p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Holding weekly family meetings is the single best improvement we made to our family. My wife adores them. Tips: play a short game at the start; have your kids pick their punishments; stop after 20 minutes. Oh, and give allowance at the end; that keeps &#x2018;em interested!</p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong> You talked to a number of experts about how to fight smarter, including simple changes you could make around the home. Which of these improved your life? </p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> My wife and I changed where we have conversations at night after we discovered we fought more because my spot put me a power position. As a family, we implemented one of my three favorite tips from the entire book: when we discipline our kids, we sit in upright, cushioned chairs. (My other favorites are &#x201c;The Law of Two Women&#x201d; and the &#x201c;What Do You Know?&#x201d;)</p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong> As you point out, the Tiger Mom approach has some downsides. Is there an animal you more identify with?</p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Pillow pet.</p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong> In the section on Warren Buffett&#x2019;s guide to allowance, you talk about the importance of having kids work. But the lemonade stand market seems overcrowded. Any alternative?</p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> First, I was quite surprised by the advice that it&#x2019;s better for kids to earn &#x2013; and lose &#x2013; their own money. Buffett&#x2019;s banker told me, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s much better to make a mistake with a $6 allowance than a $60,000 salary or a $6 million inheritance.&#x201d; And I&#x2019;m a believer in lemonade stands, but remember that the lemonade&#x2019;s a loss leader -- the money&#x2019;s in the cookies. </p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong> Are you worried you can never lose your temper at your kids in public, or people will say &#x201c;Hey, aren&#x2019;t you the Happy Family guy?&#x201d; </p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Oops, was that you behind me at the supermarket the other day? Seriously, I wrote about happy families not because we had one, but because we wanted one. Unlike most &#x201c;experts,&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t have an ideology to promote. I had a question: What do happy families do right and how can the rest of us make our families happier? We&#x2019;ve definitely improved, but kids change, so we keep having to turn back to the book. </p> <p><strong>A.J.:</strong> You start off with Tolstoy&#x2019;s famous maxim &#x201c;All happy families are alike.&#x201d; Do you agree? </p> <p><strong>Bruce:</strong> I didn&#x2019;t at first, but now I do. Happy families have certain larger things in common: They adapt all the time. They talk. A lot. They go out and play. And they work at it. We try to improve at our jobs, our hobbies, even at being ourselves, yet somehow we forget to work on the one thing that most defines our well-being -- our family. That&#x2019;s my biggest takeaway. Want to have a happier family? Try.</p><p> The book that revolutionized our view of what makes families happy . . .</p><p> Determined to find the smartest solutions and the most cutting-edge research about families, bestselling author and <em>New York Times</em> family columnist Bruce Feiler gathered team-building exercises and problem-solving techniques from the most creative minds&#x2014;from Silicon Valley to the Green Berets&#x2014;and tested these ideas with his wife and kids. The result is a lively, original look at how we can create stronger parent/child relationships, manage the chaos of our lives, teach our kids values and grit, and have more fun together.</p><p> <em>The Secrets of Happy Families</em> includes more than two hundred unique practices that will help your family draw closer and make everyone in your home happier. It has already changed the lives of millions of families, and it can do the same for yours.</p></p><h2>Daily Parts Meditation Practice(c): A Journey of Embodied Integration for Clients and Therapists</h2><p>In this second edition of Daily Parts Meditation Practice, certified IFS practitioner Michelle Glass shares the foundations of this life-changing approach to counseling and self-healing. Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a way of understanding your personal journey and identifying and addressing past trauma and coping mechanisms. One of the fundamental themes of IFS is &#x201c;parts&#x201d;&#x2014;separate facets of an individual that can work together or at odds with one another. <p> </p><p>See endorsements below. </p><p> Glass demonstrates how to create Parts Timelines, Parts Catalogue Cards, Parts Biographies, Parts Maps, Parts Externalizations, and how to develop a specific and personalized Daily Parts Meditation Practice. Through these techniques, readers learn how to develop a coherent narrative, deepen integration, accrue less burdens, and augment spiritual awakening, among others. </p><p> Glass&#x2019; exercises will help readers better understand their journeys and themselves. Whether they are new to parts work or experienced practitioners, they&#x2019;ll find these exercises teach them something new about integration. </p><p> Glass directs her work to both clients and therapists. For a therapist to successfully help clients, he or she needs to have a stable foundation. Daily Parts Meditation Practice can help them better connect with their clients and support integration. For clients, the guide can help them do their own work and better understand their journeys. </p><p> See what others have to say about the DPMP: </p><p> "As I travel around the world teaching IFS, I hear frequently from IFS clients who have been using the DPMP and loving it. I also hear from IFS therapists that they not only are having good results when their clients use it, but that they are finding it helpful for their own parts work. This second edition offers all that and more! This book will deeply enhance your journey toward being Self-led." Richard C. Schwartz, Ph.D., Developer of IFS </p><p> "In this creative volume, Michelle Glass teaches a method of deeply integrating the seemingly disharmonious voices within, by firmly establishing secure relationships between Self and hitherto isolated and fragmented parts." Gabor Mate M.D. Author, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction </p><p> "Michelle dives right into the deep end in her artistic, soulful and poetic exploration of the inner world. Using her personal journey as well as a fictional case study, Michelle offers clear, hands-on templates for identifying each part's unique story and for building strong, loving internal connections. If you want to deepen your own IFS or meditation practice, or just further expand your inner journey, this book offers a compassionate, creative and inspiring invitation." Cece Sykes, LCSW, Psychotherapist and Senior IFS Trainer </p><p> "Michelle has created a wonderful resource for the IFS community with her book, Daily Parts Meditation Practice. She offers clear, creative ways to identify, get to know, unblend from, stay connected with and integrate our parts and the system with which they live. The sharing of her personal journey is yet another example of the benefits of Self-connection and the healing power of IFS. Bravo!" Frank Anderson, M.D., Executive Director, The Foundation for Self Leadership </p><p> "With this book, you can trust both the message and the messenger implicitly. In IFS, we hold true the message: all parts are welcome, but sometimes we accidentally neglect parts after unburdening. The Daily Parts Meditation Practice will go a long way to prevent that from happening, while also strengthening the parts' gifts uncovered along the way. With these practices, transformation is a journey, not a destination. It is deeply honoring and so clearly presented."

There are some books on magick that teach it purely as spiritual advancement. There are others that teach it as a form of psychological self-help that effects only inner change. While magick can and should be both of these, it is something more. The Sorcerer's Secrets is about success in practical magick; it is a book that aims at change in both the outer and inner worlds. Beyond a mere spell book or training course, The Sorcerer's Secrets is a field manual on successful sorcery written by a professional sorcerer. The first part of the book lays out the qualities, concepts, and exercises necessary to attempt practical magick. The second part presents clear strategies for tackling almost any type of issue with sorcery. In this book you will learn how to: <br>Attack problems from multiple angles, not just by casting a spell. <br>Blend mundane and magickal action to ensure success. <br> Figure out whether what you are doing is working. <br>Fix it if it isn't. <br> Go beyond readings, into magickal intelligence-gathering. <br>Influence the minds of other people.<br> Work most effectively on behalf of others. <br><br>The Sorcerer's Secrets will help rescue the art of Magick from those who have ignored, downplayed, or just outright denied the existence of practical sorcery in favor of arcane titles, intangible results, and fantasy attainments.</p><p>Jason Miller (Inominandum) has devoted the last 20 years to studying magick in its many forms. He has traveled to New Orleans to study Hoodoo, Europe to study Witchcraft and Ceremonial Magick, and Nepal to study Tantra. Miller is a member of the Chthonic Ouranian Temple and the Sangreal Sodality, as well as an initiated Tantrika in the Nyingma and Bon lineages of Tibet. He is the author of Protection &amp; Reversal Magick: A Witch's Defense Manual and the Strategic Sorcery blog. He is also a regular contributor to Behutet magazine. Miller lives with his wife on the New Jersey shore, where he practices and teaches magick professionally.</p><h2>The Little Book of Gold: Fundraising for Small (and Very Small) Nonprofits</h2><p><p><b>A Forbes.com Top 12 Must-Read Book For Nonprofit Employees</b></p><p>The Little Book of Gold is a practical and step-by-step guide to professional fundraising.

She is meek with her hair parted down the middle. There are almost no lips to be seen, but by the way she bares her teeth you can tell she is smiling. At first the smile seems flat but the more I study it, the more it seems careless and irresponsible. There is a bundle in her arms and a hole for the newborn&#x2019;s face, which comes out red and wrinkled like an old person&#x2019;s. I know it&#x2019;s a boy because of the blue ribbon woven into the blanket edge; then I stare at the man behind Petrona. He is afroed and striking, weighing his cursed hand on her shoulder. I know what he&#x2019;s done, and it turns my stomach but who am I to say whom Petrona should allow into a family portrait such as this?</p><p>&nbsp;On the back there&#x2019;s a date stamp of when the photo was printed--and because when I count back nine months it falls exactly on the month my family and I fled from Colombia and arrived in L.A., I turn back the photograph to look intently at the baby, to register every wrinkle and bulge around the dark hole of his gaping mouth, to decide whether he is crying or laughing, because I know exactly where and how he was conceived and that&#x2019;s how I lose track of time, thinking it was my fault that the girl Petrona was just fifteen when her belly was filled with bones, and when Mama comes back from work, she does not yell (even though she sees the photograph, the envelope, the letter from Petrona all addressed to me)--no, Mama sits down next to me like taking off so much weight, and together we are quiet and sorry on our dirty stoop on Via Corona in East L.A., staring at that fucking photograph.</p><p>We were refugees when we arrived to the U.S. You must be happy now that you&#x2019;re safe, people said. They told us to strive for assimilation. The quicker we transformed into one of the many the better. But how could we choose? The U.S. was the land that saved us; Colombia was the land that saw us emerge.</p><p>There were mathematical principles to becoming an American: you had to know one hundred historical facts (What was one reason for the Civil War? Who was the president during World War II?), and you had to spend five uninterrupted years on North American soil. We memorized the facts, we stayed in place--but when I elevated my feet at night and my head found its pillow I wondered: of what country was I during those hours when my feet were in the air</p><p>&nbsp;When we applied for citizenship, I rounded the hard edges of my accent and that was one tangible way in which I had changed. We heard nothing for a year. We grew thin. We understood how little we were worth, how small our claim in the world. We had no money after our application fee, and nowhere to go. Then, we received the summons for our interview, the final background check, the examination, the approval.</p><p>At the ceremony, they screened a video filled with eagles and artillery and all of us recited a pledge. We sang our new anthem and once it was done it was said we were American. The newest batch of Americans celebrated, but in the open courtyard, I let my head hang back. I watched the sway of palm trees knowing here was where I was supposed to think about the future, and how bright it might be, but instead all I could think of was Petrona, how I was fifteen like she had been the last time I saw her.</p><p>From Mama&#x2019;s old agenda I got her address. But it wasn&#x2019;t a real address, just a set of directions Petrona had dictated to Mama back when we lived in Bogota: Petrona Sanchez at the invasion between Street 7 and 48. Kilometer 56, the house past the lilac bush. In our apartment, I locked myself in the bathroom and turned on the shower, and as the bathroom steamed I wrote the letter. I didn&#x2019;t know where to begin, so I followed the form I had learned in middle school:</p><p>Heading <i>(3 de Febrero del 2000, Chula Santiago, Los Angeles, Estados Unidos)</i>, respectful greeting <i>(Querida Petrona)</i>, body that uses easy and exact vocabulary <i>(Petrona, como estas? Como esta tu familia?)</i>, each new paragraph with first line indented <i>(Mi familia esta bien. / Estoy leyendo Don Quixote. / Los Angeles es bonita, pero no tan bonita como Bogota)</i>. The closing line was next, but instead I wrote about what it was like to flee from Colombia; how we boarded a plane, Bogota to Miami to Houston to L.A., how I prayed for no immigration officers to stop us and send us back, how I could not stop thinking about everything we had lost. When we first arrived to L.A. it was impossibly sunny and all I could smell was the salt from the ocean. The smell of salt burned my nose when I breathed in. I wrote paragraph after paragraph about salt, like I was crazy <i>(We washed our hands with salt to reverse bad luck. / Salt was the one thing Mama bought when she was afraid to spend our money. / I read in a magazine that packaged salt has crushed animal bone in it, which disgusted me until I realized that so must the ocean&#x2019;s. Beach sand was part bones too).</i> In the end all the talk about salt came to feel like some type of code.<i> It&#x2019;s gotten so,</i> I wrote, <i>I can&#x2019;t even smell salt anymore.</i> It became my closing line, not because I meant it to be but because suddenly I had nothing more to say.</p><p>I never asked the one thing I wanted to know: <i>Petrona, when we left, where did you go?</i></p><p>When Petrona&#x2019;s reply arrived, I tried to find hidden messages behind the ordinary information she volunteered: the nice weather, the newly paved road to her house in the invasion, the lettuces, the cabbages in season.</p><p>In the end it didn&#x2019;t matter her letter back to me was so ordinary, because all the answers I could ever hunger for were printed on that photograph, which she creased in half and placed in the folds of her letter before licking the envelope and pressing it shut, before handing the letter to the postman, before it traveled just like how I once did, Bogota to Miami to Houston to L.A., before it arrived bringing with it all this wreckage to our doorstep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2.&nbsp;The Girl Petrona</b></p><p>The girl Petrona came to our home when I was seven and my sister Cassandra was nine. She was thirteen and had only gone through the third grade. She stood with a tattered brown suitcase at the gate of our three-story house in a yellow dress that dangled at her ankles. Her hair was short and her mouth was hanging open.</p><p>The garden yawned between us like an abyss. Cassandra and I gazed at the girl Petrona from behind the two left-most columns of our house. The white columns rose from the porch and supported the overhang of the second floor. The second floor stuck out like an overbite. It was a typical Bogot� house, made to look like the old colonials, white with wide windows and black iron bars and a clay roof with red-blue half-moon tiles. It was part of a row of identical houses linked one to the other by the sidewalls. I didn&#x2019;t know then why the girl Petrona looked at our house that way, but Cassandra and I gaped back at her with the same kind of awe. The girl Petrona lived in an invasion. There were invasiones in almost every tall hill in the city, government land taken over by the displaced and the poor. Mama herself had grown up in an invasion--but not in Bogot�.</p><p>From behind her column Cassandra asked, &#x201c;Did you see what she&#x2019;s wearing, Chula? That&#x2019;s a <i>boy</i> haircut she has.&#x201d; She widened her eyes behind her glasses. Cassandra&#x2019;s glasses took up a great deal of her face. They were pink-rimmed and oversized and magnified the pores on her cheeks. Mama was waving at the girl Petrona from the front door. She sprang forward into the garden, clicking her heels on the stepping-stones and bouncing her hair on her back.</p><p>The girl Petrona watched Mama as she approached.</p><p>Mama was a natural beauty. That&#x2019;s what other people said. Strange men on the street stopped her in order to pay compliments to the dramatic breadth of her eyebrows or the pull of her deep, brown eyes. Mama didn&#x2019;t like going through pains for her beauty, but she woke up every morning to apply thick black liner to her eyes, and drove monthly to the salon to get her toenails done, arguing all the while that it was worth it, because her eyes were the well of her power and her small feet the mark of her innocence.</p><p>The night before the girl Petrona arrived Mama made three stacks with her tarot cards on her breakfast table and asked, &#x201c;Is the girl Petrona trustworthy?&#x201d; She put the question in a number of ways with a variety of tones until she felt she was asking the question with one mind; then she picked the top card from the middle stack. She flipped the card over and laid it in front of her and saw that it was the Fool. Her hand froze in midair as she regarded the upside-down card. The card depicted a white man smiling caught in a half step looking dreamily to the sky, in one hand a white rose and over his shoulder a golden satchel. He wore leggings and boots and a princelike flouncy dress. At his feet a white dog leaped. The man wasn&#x2019;t looking, but he was about to fall off a cliff.</p><p>Mama collected the stacks in her hands, reshuffling: &#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ve been warned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Should we tell Papa?&#x201d; I asked. Papa worked at an oil site far away in Sincelejo and I was never sure when he was due back for a visit. Mama said Papa had to work far away because there were no jobs in Bogot�, but all I knew was that sometimes we told Papa about things, and sometimes we didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Mama laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all the same anyway. <i>Any </i>girl you hire in this city will have ties to hooligans. Just look at Dolores down the block--her girl was part of a gang and they robbed Dolores&#x2019;s house, imagine: they didn&#x2019;t even leave the microwave.&#x201d; Mama saw the worry on my face. Her eyeliner ran thickly and ticked up at the corners. The tick wrinkled as she smiled. She dug her finger in my ribs. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too serious. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;</p><p>In the front garden Cassandra said from behind her column, &#x201c;This girl Petrona won&#x2019;t last a month--look at her; she has the spirit of a mosquito.&#x201d; I blinked and saw that it was true. The girl Petrona shrank back as Mama opened the gate.</p><p>Mama always had bad luck with girls. The last girl, Julieta, was fired because Mama had walked into the kitchen at the wrong time and saw Julieta form her mouth around a drop of spit, and as the girl Julieta looked up the spit plunged into Mama&#x2019;s morning coffee. When Mama demanded an explanation, the girl Julieta said, &#x201c;Maybe the Senora&#x2019;s eyes are seeing things.&#x201d; A second later Mama was throwing the girl Julieta&#x2019;s belongings on the street, and grabbing the girl Julieta by the collar saying, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t come back, Julieta, don&#x2019;t you bother coming back,&#x201d; pushing her out of the door and slamming it shut.</p><p>Mama hired girls based on the urgency of their situation. She sought out girls employed at other houses and gave them our telephone number in case somebody they knew needed a job. Mama heard sad stories of families struck by illness, pregnancy, displaced by war, and even though we could only offer five thousand pesos per day, enough for some vegetables and rice at the market, many girls were interested in applying. I think Mama was always hiring girls that reminded her of herself in her youth, but it never turned out how she wanted.</p><p>One girl had almost stolen Cassandra when she was a baby. Mama didn&#x2019;t know her name, only that she was infertile--except how Mama put it was that the girl was barren like beach sand in a drought. Most people we knew got kidnapped in the routine way: at the hands of guerrillas, held at ransom and then returned, or disappeared. The way Cassandra almost got kidnapped was a fun twist on an all too common story. There was a photograph of the infertile girl in question in our family album. She looked out from behind the slick of the plastic sheet with frizzy hair and a missing front tooth. Mama said she kept the girl&#x2019;s photo in our album because it was all part of our family history. Even the photos of Papa as a communist youth were there for anyone to see. He wore bell-bottom jeans and dark sunglasses. His teeth were clenched and his fist was in the air. He looked sophisticated, but Mama said not to be fooled, because really Papa was as lost as Adam from the Bible would be on Mother&#x2019;s Day.</p><p>Ours was a kingdom of women, with Mama at the head, perpetually trying to find a fourth like us, or a fourth like her, a younger version of Mama, poor and eager to climb out of poverty, on whom Mama could right the wrongs she herself had endured.</p><p>At the gate, Mama extended her hand firmly to the girl Petrona. The girl Petrona was slow so Mama scooped her hand in both of hers and moved it rigidly up and down. The girl Petrona&#x2019;s arm undulated free and loose like a wave. &#x201c;How do you do?&#x201d; Mama said. The girl Petrona merely assented and locked her eyes on to the ground. Cassandra was right. This girl Petrona would not last a month. Mama put an arm around the girl Petrona and led her into our garden, except instead of going up the stone steps to our front door they veered to the left. Together they walked toward the bed of flowers at the edge of the garden. They stopped in front of the tree closest to the gate and then Mama pointed at the tree and whispered.</p><p>We called it el Borrachero, the Drunken Tree. Papa called it by its scientific name, <i>Brugmansia arborea alba</i>, but nobody ever knew what he was talking about. It was a tall tree with twisted limbs, big white flowers, and dark brown fruits. All of the tree, even the leaves, was filled with poison. The tree drooped half over our garden, half over the neighborhood sidewalk, releasing a honeyed scent like a seductive, expensive perfume.</p></p><h2>Understanding Show, Don&#39;t Tell: And Really Getting It</h2><p><b>Do you struggle with show, don't tell? You don't have to.&nbsp;</b> <br> Award-winning author Janice Hardy (and founder of the popular writing site, Fiction University) takes you deep into one of the most frustrating aspects of writing--showing, and not telling. She'll help you understand what show, don't tell means, teach you how to spot told prose in your writing, and reveal why common advice on how to fix it doesn't always work. <br> With in-depth analysis, <i><b>Understanding Show, Don't Tell (And Really Getting It)</b></i> looks at what affects told prose and when telling is the <i>right </i>thing to do. It also explores aspects of writing that aren&#x2019;t technically telling, but are connected to told prose and can make prose feel told, such as infodumps, description, and backstory. <br> Her easy-to-understand examples will show you clear before and after text and demonstrate how telling words change the prose. You'll learn how to find the right balance between description, narrative, and internalization for the strongest impact. These examples will also demonstrate why showing the <i>wrong</i> details can sound just as dull as telling. <br> This book will help you: <ul> <li>Understand when to tell and when to show</li> <li>Spot common red flag words often found in told prose</li> <li>Learn why one single rule doesn't apply to all books</li> <li>Determine how much telling is acceptable in your writing</li> <li>Fix stale or flat prose holding your writing back</li> </ul> <b><i>Understanding Show, Don't Tell (And Really Getting It)</i></b> is more than just advice on what to do and what not to do&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a down and dirty examination and analysis of how show, don&#x2019;t tell works, so you can adapt the &#x201c;rules&#x201d; to whatever style or genre you&#x2019;re writing. By the end of this book, you&#x2019;ll have a solid understanding of show, don&#x2019;t tell and the ability to use it without fear or frustration.</p><p>Janice Hardy is the award-winning author of the teen fantasy trilogy TheHealing Wars.

So was the forest.<br> &nbsp;<br> Softly the wind moved over the land.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the hut&#x2014;one of six that nestled together in the little hamlet by the river&#x2014;the sleeping mother lay with her child.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had no sense of danger.<br> &nbsp;<br> High in the starlit summer sky, pale clouds passed from time to time, drifting in a leisurely procession, glowing softly in the reflection of a crescent moon that rode to the south.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like horsemen they came from the east with their billowing white canopies, from who knew what endless steppes&#x2014;sweeping majestically over the little collection of huts by the river&#x2019;s edge and continuing their journey behind the hamlet over the dark forest that very likely was also without end.<br> &nbsp;<br> The hamlet lay on the southeastern bank of the stream. There, the woods of oak and lime, pine and birch grew thinner, gradually giving way to glades and the broad stretches of open grassland that were the outermost edges of the mighty steppe. Across the small river, on the northwest bank, the forest was thick, dark, and unbroken.<br> &nbsp;<br> The three families who inhabited the place had arrived five summers before and, finding there an ancient, deserted earthwork enclosure overgrown with scrub, had cleared it, put up a wooden palisade on the low earth wall, and built half a dozen huts inside. Nearby, two large fields cut untidy swaths into the trees. Farther into the woods, a messy patchwork of smaller clearings appeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few hundred yards downstream, the land on both sides became marshy and remained so for a couple of miles.<br> &nbsp;<br> Softly the wind moved over the land. It caressed the tops of the trees, so that the light undersides of the leaves shimmered pale in the starlight. The waters of the winding river and the marsh glimmered in the woods.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were few sounds except for the gentle stirring of the leaves. Here and there might be heard the sounds of small animals, or of the deer quietly walking. At a certain point near the marsh, against the monotonous background of the frogs&#x2019; croaking, an attentive ear might have picked up the crackle of a bear making its way along the wood&#x2019;s edge. But by the hamlet the only sound was that of the leaves, and the intermittent rustle as the breeze stroked the long field of barley, sending a ripple like a momentary shiver down its length.<br> &nbsp;<br> The wind moved, yet did not move. For sometimes the field stood still, or swayed in another direction, as though the wind from the east had paused, lazily, before brushing the ripened barley once again.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the year A.D. 180&#x2014;and yet it was not. That is to say, although future times would give to this year such a number, as yet the Christian calendar was not in use. Far south, in the Roman province of Judea where Jesus of Nazareth had lived, learned Jewish rabbis had calculated that it was the year A.M. 3940. It was also the one hundred tenth year since the destruction of Jerusalem. Elsewhere in the mighty Roman Empire, it was the twentieth and last year of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, also the first year of the single rule of Commodus. In Persia it was the year 491 of the Seleucid era.<br> &nbsp;<br> What year was it here then, in the tiny hamlet at the forest&#x2019;s edge? So far as history is aware, it was not any year. It was five years since the last village elder died. The huge systems of numbering familiar to the civilized world, and kept in written texts, were unknown here.<br> &nbsp;<br> For this was the land that would one day be known as Russia.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Softly the wind moved over the land.<br> &nbsp;<br> She lay with her little boy. The worrying thoughts of the day before had passed from her mind in sleep like the pale clouds receding over the forest behind the river. She slept at peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were twelve people sleeping in the hut. Five of them, including Lebed and her child, lay on the broad shelf that ran across the room over the big stove. On this warm summer night the stove was unlit. The air was thick with the sweet, earthy smell&#x2014;not unpleasant&#x2014;of folk who have worked all day in the field harvesting. To this was added the fresh scent of grasses carried in by the breeze through the square, open frame of the window.<br> &nbsp;<br> She lay at one end of the wooden shelf&#x2014;a lowly position&#x2014;because she was the most junior of her husband&#x2019;s wives. She was twenty-seven, no longer young. Her face was broad and her body had already developed a stocky roundness at the hips. Her thick fair hair had slid over the edge of the shelf.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beside her, in the curve of her plump arm, lay a little boy of five. She had had other children before him, but they had died, and so he was all she possessed.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had been fifteen when she married and she had always known that her husband had only taken her because she was strong: she was there to work. But she had few complaints. He was not unkind. Still a tall, good-looking man at forty, his weather-beaten face had something soft, even wistful about it, and usually when he saw her his light blue eyes would gleam with a gentle, mocking amusement as he called, &#x201c;Here comes my Mordvinian.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With him, it was a term of affection. With the others, however, it was not.<br> &nbsp;<br> For Lebed was not a full member of the tribe. To her husband&#x2019;s clan she was a half-breed: after all, what was her mother&#x2014;one of the forest folk? A Mordvinian?<br> &nbsp;<br> Since time began, the forests and marshes that stretched northward for hundreds of miles had contained the scattered tribes of Finno-Ugrian peoples to which her mother&#x2019;s tribe belonged. Broad-faced Mongoloid folk with yellowish skins, they hunted and fished in those huge, deserted regions, living a primitive existence in their little huts and pit dwellings. At the solstice they would stand in a circle and sing, in a high, harsh, nasal chant, to the pale sun who, as one traveled farther north, would scarcely show his face in winter and in summer would deny the earth her nightly rest as he bathed the land in a long, white twilight and made the horizon tremble with pale flashes.<br> &nbsp;<br> In recent times her husband&#x2019;s people&#x2014;fair-skinned folk speaking a Slavic tongue&#x2014;had been sending out little colonies east and north into this forest. Some of these, like her husband&#x2019;s clan, cultivated fields and kept cattle. When these Slavs and the primitive Finns encountered each other in those vast regions, there was seldom any conflict. There was land and hunting enough for ten thousand times their numbers. Marriages like her mother&#x2019;s took place. But the settlers of the hamlet looked down upon the forest folk all the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was her husband&#x2019;s joke to call her by the name not of her mother&#x2019;s little tribe, but of the great tribe of Mordvinians that lay far to the north. It made her sound more foreign, even though she was half pure Slav. And, she reflected sadly, it reminded the rest of the clan to look down on her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Especially her mother-in-law. For nearly thirteen years her large, powerful figure had loomed over Lebed&#x2019;s life like a threatening cloudbank in the sky. Sometimes, for days at a time, the other woman&#x2019;s leonine face with its big, heavy cheeks would seem to be serene, even friendly. But then some small mistake on her part&#x2014;a spindle dropped, sour cream spilled&#x2014;would call forth a thundering rage. The other women of the house would be silent, either looking down at the floor or watching her furtively. And she knew that they were glad&#x2014;both that they had escaped and that the anger was falling on her, the outsider. After the burst of rage, her mother-in-law would abruptly tell her to get back to work and then turn to the rest of them with a shrug.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What can you expect from a poor Mordvinian?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was easy to bear. But her own family made it harder. Both her parents had died the previous year, leaving only her and a younger brother. And it was he who had made her weep the day before.<br> &nbsp;<br> He meant no harm. But he was always in trouble with the village elder. His broad, slightly foolish face was always smiling, even when he was drunk: and he seemed to have only two desires in life&#x2014;to hunt and to please his little nephew.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kiy doesn&#x2019;t need you,&#x201d; she would tell him, &#x201c;and nor do I if you won&#x2019;t obey the elder.&#x201d; But it was useless. He hated the work in the fields, would disappear for days into the forest without permission&#x2014;while the villagers muttered about him angrily&#x2014;and then she would suddenly see his strong, square form come striding back, with a dozen pelts hanging from his belt and his habitual, foolish smile on his face. The elder would curse him and her mother-in-law would look at her with renewed disgust, as if it were her fault.</p><h2>Stealing Freedom</h2><p><i>Inspired by a true story, the riveting novel of a young slave girl's harrowing escape to freedom on the Underground Railroad.</i><br><br>The moment Ann Maria Weems was born, her freedom was stolen from her. Like her family and the other slaves on the farm, Ann works from sunup to sundown and obeys the orders of her master. Then one day, Ann's family -- the only joy she knows -- is gone. Just 12 years old, Ann is overcome by grief, struggling to get through each day. And her only hope of stealing back her freedom and finding her family lies in a perilous journey: the Underground Railroad.<br><br>Ann Maria Weems was an actual slave who lived in the mid-1800s near the author's home in Maryland.</p><p><blockquote><i> "'Papa, is that bad, what Uncle Abram tried to do--steal his freedom like that?' Ann asked.<br> Her father stopped and stared at her. 'He wasn't stealing anything that wasn't rightfully his,' he said very softly. 'Anyone born a slave gets their freedom stolen the day they're born.'" </i></blockquote><p> Ann Maria Weems was a slave who lived in Maryland in the mid-1800s, and in the engaging, suspenseful novel <i>Stealing Freedom</i>, Elisa Carbone tells her story. As she wrote, Carbone painstakingly pieced Ann's experiences together with old newspaper articles; letters found in boxes in Philadelphia and Ohio; and material culled from rare books, census and land records, wills, and graveyards. She read thousands of pages of slave narratives, and recorded the emotion she heard in these men and women's voices in her own work. The resulting novel--powerful, vivid, and a tale well told--is, according to the author, a combination of what really happened and what could have happened. Every character in her book is based on someone who lived during the 19th century.</p><p> The story begins in 1853 at the Price farm in Unity, Maryland, where the Weems family lives and works. Though 10-year-old Ann works from sunup to sundown in often harsh conditions, her life is not an unhappy one, as she is surrounded by a loving family. But the reality of slavery is ever present. When the Prices begin to sell Ann's family off, person by person, her father (a free slave) vows that if the family can't be together in slavery, they will be together in freedom. Finally, only 12-year-old Ann is left on the farm, and young readers will be moved by her courageous journey--from her dramatic escape with a white abolitionist, to her travels on the Underground Railroad, to her heart-wrenching reunion with her family in Canada. (Ages 11 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Elisa Carbone has lectured about Ann Maria Weems&#39;s life to teachers and historians.</p><h2>Becoming Heart Sisters Participant Workbook</h2><p><p>Friendships with other women are as important to our mental, physical, and spiritual health as rest, exercise, and prayer.

With hundreds of thousands of copies sold since its initial publication, and as a frequent selection as one book/one school/one community reads, this unforgettable memoir continues to touch and inspire readers. This special expanded fifteenth anniversary edition includes a new introduction and afterword from the author, a discussion guide, and more. <br></p><p>Mawi Asgedom is an author, sought-after speaker, and educator. He has inspired over one million students through his books, speeches, and award-winning online leadership courses. Oprah Winfrey called her interview with Mawi one of her top twenty moments, and Essence recognized Mawi as one of the "40 of the Most Inspiring African-Americans."<br><br>As a child, Mawi fled civil war in Ethiopia and survived a Sudanese refugee camp for three years. After being resettled in the United States, Mawi overcame poverty, language barriers, and personal tragedy to graduate cum laude from Harvard University, where he gave the commencement address to an audience of thirty thousand.<br><br>Mawi lives in Illinois with his family. He invites you to learn more about his work in education at MawiLearning.com.When he was four years old, Asgedom's family left their war-ravaged home in Ethiopia. They spent three years in a Sudanese refugee camp before coming to the U.S. in 1983, where they were settled by World Relief in a wealthy white suburb near Chicago. He later earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where in 1999 he delivered the commencement address. His simple lyrical narrative, both wry and tender, stays true to the child's viewpoint as he grows up, taunted at school, but pretty bad and rough himself. His coming-of-age story is both darkened and enriched by the stories he hears about his parents' lives back home and by the pieces he remembers. At the center of the book is his father, a fierce family disciplinarian, once an all-powerful medical assistant at home, now reduced to a "beetle," unemployed, half-blind, raging at his dependency. Only at the very end, when Asgedom spells out the metaphor of the title, does the message overwhelm the story. What stays with you is the quiet, honest drama of a family's heartrending journey. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Has your intimacy and closeness turned into angry words with smoldering discontent? In a world where Christian marriage and family is to be a beacon of love, faith, and hope, we find Christian marriages failing at an alarming rate. Like many Christian couples today, Lori Alexander and her husband, Ken, found themselves in a modern marriage partnership as two strong leaders who both loved each other, but could not find the oneness they knew God desired for their marriage. In The Power of a Transformed Wife, Lori bravely takes you with her on her 35-year journey of marriage showing the good and the bad as two strong people discover that doing things God&#x2019;s ways produces exactly what God has promised. It is a journey out of the Christian feministic thinking that has infiltrated the Church and into the ever so simple concept that female equality does not mean that a modern day Christian wife cannot joyfully and willingly choose to submit to her husband as she submits to the Lordship of Christ in her life. If you are brave enough to challenge yourself with the simple message of marriage done God&#x2019;s way, then you will have to walk past the few, but vocal dissenters, who will do all they can to shout down and drown out the plain teaching of the Bible. Lori Alexander has a large following of Christian women who chose to daily hear her common sense biblical approach to marriage and family. After regularly hearing from women around the world who have been touched by God&#x2019;s simple transforming Word on marriage, Lori now gives a succinct summary of how she became a Transformed Wife. How she stepped out of the need to be right and in control of the marriage to trust God at His Word and in turn trust Ken. Her mission is to fulfill the biblical admonition for the older women to train the younger women how to love their husbands, love their children, and be keepers at home. &#x201c;Wives submit to your husbands in everything,&#x201d; is not for the fainthearted, but for the strong Christian woman who desires God&#x2019;s blessings by doing things God&#x2019;s ways. Thousands of Christian women are finding joy and closeness with their husbands by going back to a biblical marriage and family model that is rarely taught in the Church anymore. This frightens many feminists, and some Christians, to think that what women have seemingly gained over the past 50 years of feminism might be lost on a new generation of young Christian women who are going back to God&#x2019;s Word for the answers to a fulfilling marriage and family life. The life of Jesus is one of love and sacrifice, and it is His life we must seek to follow no matter how counter-culture it may be, even when it may lead to ridicule or promised persecution. Dare to &#x201c;be transformed by the renewing of your mind,&#x201d; as this book challenges the Christian young woman, wife, and mother to be 100% biblical in how she is to live out her faith and marriage.</p><p>Lori Alexander&#x2019;s writings have reached over 22 million in one post as they are championed by the conservative Christian and much maligned and attacked by those who hate the idea of a wife&#x2019;s willing submission to her husband or disciplining a defiant child. It is Lori&#x2019;s plain talking, practical approach that takes God at His Word on marriage and family that has many Christians asking why their pastors are no longer teaching these things. It also is causing fireworks in cyberspace as her trolls dog her wherever they can to give a contrary opinion or malicious word. Some will love her and some will hate her, but none can say she is not consistently biblical in her writings, even as they fly in the face of a perverse culture. The accusations are that she is too biblical, or too biblically literal, yet what she teaches is clearly spelled out for all who care to read it and believe it in God&#x2019;s Word. Lori is a Christian mother to four wonderful children and has been married for 35 years to Ken, her provider, and protector. Her ministry was born out of pain, much lifelong physical pain, that has for many years kept her close to home. Her modest desire was to mentor younger women and coach them how to not to make the same mistakes she had made the first 20 years of marriage. In mentoring, she desired to fulfill the command God has given for the older women to train the younger women to love their husbands, love their children, and be keepers at home. Starting out with a one-on-one ministry for her church, her ministry quickly blossomed on the Internet where thousands read her daily posts and find wisdom based on a high view of scriptural authority. Lori and Ken have always lived together in a very normal Christian family and marriage. They come to their conclusions by reading the word of God for themselves and desiring to believe all of it, even those things that are hard to understand. They enjoy studying the Bible and defending their biblical positions but they also feel no compulsion to try to manipulate or force anyone to believe as they believe. Instead, they challenge every reader to come to their own conclusions after checking out everything they see or hear with what the Bible teaches. The Alexander family has been greatly blessed by the Lord and Lori desires Christian women to find what she has found without having to go through the difficulties of her early years in marriage.</p><h2>The Scars That Have Shaped Me: How God Meets Us in Suffering</h2><p><p>Twenty-one surgeries by age thirteen. Years in the hospital. Verbal and physical bullying from schoolmates. Multiple miscarriages as a young wife. The death of a child. A debilitating progressive disease. Riveting pain. Abandonment. Unwanted divorce.</p> <p>Vaneetha Rendall Risner begged God for grace that would deliver her. But God offered something better: his <em>sustaining</em> grace.</p> <p>In <em>The Scars That Have Shaped Me</em>, published by Desiring God, Vaneetha does more than share her stories of pain; she invites other sufferers to taste with her the goodness of a sovereign God who will carry us in our darkest of days.</p> <p>&#x201c;Vaneetha writes with creativity, biblical faithfulness, compelling style, and an experiential authenticity that draws other sufferers in. Here you will find both a tested life and a love for the sovereignty of a good and gracious God.&#x201d; &#x2013;JOHN PIPER</p> <p>&#x201c;A special kind of wisdom. Nothing short of remarkable.

Reveling in the sovereign grace of God in your pain will bolster your faith like nothing this world can offer, and Vaneetha knows how to lead you to this living water."<br> --<strong>Gloria Furman</strong> <strong>, </strong>author of<em> Missional Motherhood</em> and <em>Alive in Him</em></p><p>"When we are suffering significantly, it's hard to receive truth from those who haven't been there. But <strong>Vaneetha Risner's credibility makes us willing to lean in and listen</strong>. Her writing is built on her experience of deep pain, and in the midst of that her rugged determination to hold on to Christ."<br> --<strong>Nancy Guthrie</strong>, author of <em>Hearing Jesus Speak into Your Sorrow</em></p><p>"I have often wondered how Vaneetha Rendall Risner endures suffering with such amazing joy, grace, and perseverance. I still don't understand that, but this book has given me a new glimpse into her world and into the character of our loving God. <strong>Raw, transparent, terrifying, and yet amazingly hopeful</strong>, <em>The Scars that Have Shaped Me</em> can provide strength for the journey regardless of your situation."<br> --<strong>Brian Fikkert</strong>, co-author of <em>When Helping Hurts: How to Alleviate Poverty Without Hurting the Poor...and Yourself</em></p><p>"<strong>It's hard to find words to express how vitally important </strong><strong>Vaneetha's</strong><strong> testimony has been in the shaping of my life and faith.</strong> She has walked uniquely hard roads and ventured into deep spiritual waters, yet always welcomes fellow travelers like me. These pages are full of vulnerability and hope, rooted not in optimism but in the real-life experience of God's faithfulness in suffering. It is truly oxygen to get a glimpse of God's face through Vaneetha's eyes."<br> --<strong>Christa Wells</strong>, singer, songwriter</p><p>"When I'm in a hard place and needing to draw deeply into God, I want to hear from someone who knows and understands. Someone who's been there. I can think of no better voice than Vaneetha Risner's. In both the sudden crisis and the long, relentless daily struggle, <strong>Vaneetha's insights have been purchased in the fire of adversity. So I listen.</strong> She leads through a door that comforts my soul and straightens my spine--I am in her debt. You will be, too, as you drink deeply the wisdom she has to offer."<br> --<strong>Paula Rinehart</strong>, author of <em>Strong Women, Soft Hearts </em>and<em> Sex and the Soul of a Woman</em></p></p><h2>The Birds of Bethlehem</h2><p>A perfect first Christmas book <br><br>This inventive and fresh Nativity story is told from a bird's-eye view. On the morning of the first Christmas, the birds of Bethlehem gather in the fields--not only to eat but to share the exciting news. People from all over have descended on Bethlehem and an angel has appeared in the night sky. Something extraordinary is coming! The birds agree that they must find this wondrous thing, and off they fly to the stable where a child has been born. <br><br>In simple language and dazzling pictures, beloved author-illustrator Tomie dePaola shares the awe and anticipation of the first Christmas. His cast of brightly colored, curious birds will appeal to young children, making this a perfect introduction to the story of Christmas.</p><p>Tomie dePaola is the acclaimed author and/or illustrator of more than 200 books for children. He has received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, a Newbery Honor for <i>26 Fairmount Avenue</i> and a Caldecott Honor for <i>Strega Nona</i>. He was awarded the Smithson Medal, the Regina Medal (from the Catholic Library Association), and was designated a "living treasure" by the state of New Hampshire. He lives in New London, New Hampshire.While pecking for grain in the fields, Bethlehem&#x2019;s birds discuss what they saw the previous night. A green bird noticed many people walking over the hills. A yellow bird observed something unusual: the inn was full. A blue bird saw something strange: a couple housed in the inn&#x2019;s stable. A red bird witnessed something extraordinary: an angel appearing to shepherds, announcing &#x201c;tidings of great joy,&#x201d; and telling them to visit a baby in a manger. Together, the birds fly to the stable to see the miracle. While stories about animals visiting baby Jesus are not uncommon, it is unusual to find one with a short text that traces the Nativity story reverently and without sentimentality. On the handsome dust jacket, the title&#x2019;s silver letters have an iridescent sheen that shifts colors as the angle of light changes. It&#x2019;s a playful, slightly mysterious element welcoming children to the story within. Painted in acrylics, the illustrations are notable for their simplified forms, pleasing compositions, and subtle combinations of colors. An inviting read-aloud choice for Christmas.

By what alchemy does Jackson Pollock's drip painting <i>No. 5, 1948 </i>sell for $140 million? </p><p>Intriguing and entertaining, <i>The $12 Million Stuffed Shark</i> is a <i>Freakonomics</i> approach to the economics and psychology of the contemporary art world. Why were record prices achieved at auction for works by 131 contemporary artists in 2006 alone, with astonishing new heights reached in 2007? Don Thompson explores the money, lust, and self-aggrandizement of the art world in an attempt to determine what makes a particular work valuable while others are ignored.</p><p>This book is the first to look at the economics and the marketing strategies that enable the modern art market to generate such astronomical prices. Drawing on interviews with past and present executives of auction houses and art dealerships, artists, and the buyers who move the market, Thompson launches the reader on a journey of discovery through the peculiar world of modern art. Surprising, passionate, gossipy, revelatory, <i>The $12 Million Stuffed Shark</i> reveals a great deal that even experienced auction purchasers do not know.</p></p><p><b>Don Thompson</b> teaches marketing and economics in the MBA program at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto. He has taught at the London School of Economics and at Harvard Business School. He lives in London and Toronto.January 13, 2005, New York<br><br>One problem for the agent trying to sell the stuffed shark was the $12 million asking price for this work of contemporary art.* Another was that it weighed just over two tons, and was not going to be easy to carry home. The taxidermy fifteen-foot tiger shark &#x201c;sculpture&#x201d; was mounted in a giant glass vitrine and creatively named <i>The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living</i>. It is illustrated in the center portion of the book. The shark had been caught in 1991 in Australia, and prepared and mounted in England by technicians working under the direction of British artist Damien Hirst.<br><br>Another concern was that while the shark was certainly a novel artistic concept, many in the art world were uncertain whether it qualified as art. The question was important because $12 million represented more money than had ever been paid for a work by a living artist, other than Jasper Johns &#x2013; more than for a Gerhard Richter, a Robert Rauschenberg, or a Lucian Freud.<br><br>Why would anyone even consider paying this much money for the shark? Part of the answer is that in the world of contemporary art, branding can substitute for critical judgment, and lots of branding was involved here. The seller was Charles Saatchi, an advertising magnate and famous art collector, who fourteen years earlier had commissioned Hirst to produce the work for �50,000. At the time that sum was considered so ridiculous that <i>The Sun </i>heralded the transaction with the headline &#x201c;50,000 For Fish Without Chips.&#x201d; Hirst intended the figure to be an &#x201c;outrageous&#x201d; price, set as much for the publicity it would attract as for the monetary return.<br><br>The agent selling the shark was New York-based Larry Gagosian, the world&#x2019;s most famous art dealer. One buyer known to be actively pursuing the shark was Sir Nicholas Serota, director of London&#x2019;s Tate Modern museum, who had a very constrained budget to work with. Four collectors with much greater financial means had shown moderate interest. The most promising was American Steve Cohen, a very rich Connecticut hedge fund executive. Hirst, Saatchi, Gagosian, Tate, Serota, and Cohen represented more art world branding than is almost ever found in one place. Saatchi&#x2019;s ownership and display of the shark had become a symbol for newspaper writers of the shock art being produced by the group known as the Young British Artists, the yBas. Put the branding and the publicity together and the shark must be art, and the price must not be unreasonable.<br><br>There was another concern, serious enough that with any other purchase it might have deterred buyers. The shark had deteriorated dramatically since it was first unveiled at Saatchi&#x2019;s private gallery in London in 1992. Because the techniques used to preserve it had been inadequate, the original had decomposed until its skin became heavily wrinkled and turned a pale green, a fin had fallen off, and the formaldehyde solution in the tank had turned murky. The intended illusion had been of a tiger shark swimming toward the viewer through the white space of the gallery, hunting for dinner. The illusion now was described as entering Norman Bates&#x2019; fruit cellar and finding Mother embalmed in her chair. Curators at the Saatchi Gallery tried adding bleach to the formaldehyde, but this only hastened the decay. In 1993 the curators gave up and had the shark skinned. The skin was then stretched over a weighted fiberglass mold. The shark was still greenish, still wrinkled.<br><br>Damien Hirst had not actually caught the now-decaying shark. Instead he made &#x201c;Shark Wanted&#x201d; telephone calls to post offices on the Australian coast, which put up posters giving his London number. He paid �6,000 for the shark: �4,000 to catch it and �2,000 to pack it in ice and ship it to London. There was the question of whether Hirst could replace this rotting shark simply by purchasing and stuffing a new one. Many art historians would argue that if refurbished or replaced, the shark became a different artwork. If you overpainted a Renoir, it would not be the same work. But if the shark was a conceptual piece, would catching an equally fierce shark and replacing the original using the same name be acceptable? Dealer Larry Gagosian drew a weak analogy to American installation artist Dan Flavin, who works with fluorescent light tubes. If a tube on a Flavin sculpture burns out, you replace it. Charles Saatchi, when asked if refurbishing the shark would rob it of its meaning as art, responded &#x201c;Completely.&#x201d; So what is more important&#x2013;the original artwork or the artist&#x2019;s intention?<br><br>Nicolas Serota offered Gagosian $2 million on behalf of Tate Modern, but it was turned down. Gagosian continued his sales calls. When alerted that Saatchi intended to sell soon, Cohen agreed to buy.<br><br>Hirst, Saatchi, and Gagosian are profiled later in the book. But who is Steve Cohen? Who pays $12 million for a decaying shark? Cohen is an example of the financial-sector buyer who drives the market in high-end contemporary art. He is the owner of SAC. Capital Advisors, LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, and is considered a genius. He manages $11 billion in assets and is said to earn $500 million a year. He displays his trophy art in a 32,000 square foot mansion in Greenwich, a 6,000 square foot pied-�-terre in Manhattan, and a 19,000 square foot bungalow in Delray Beach, Florida. In 2007 he purchased a ten bedroom, two acre estate in East Hampton, New York.<br><br>To put the $12 million price tag in context it is necessary to understand how rich really rich is. Assume Mr Cohen has a net worth of $4 billion to go with an annual income of $500 million before tax. At a 10 percent rate of return &#x2013; far less than he actually earns on the assets he manages &#x2013; his total income is just over $16 million a week, or $90,000 an hour. The shark cost him five days&#x2019; income.<br><br>Some journalists later expressed doubt whether the selling price for<i> Physical Impossibility</i> actually was $12 million. Several New York media reported that the only other firm offer aside from that made by Tate Modern came from Cohen, and the actual selling price was $8 million. <i>New York Magazine</i> reported $13 million. But the $12 million figure was the most widely cited, it produced extensive publicity, and the parties agreed not to discuss the amount. At any of these numbers, the sale greatly increased the value of the other Hirst work in the Saatchi collection.<br><br>Cohen was not sure what to do with the shark; it remained stored in England. He said he might donate it to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York &#x2013; which might have led to his being offered a position on the MoMA board. The art world heralded the purchase as a victory for MoMA over London&#x2019;s Tate Modern. London&#x2019;s <i>Guardian</i> newspaper bemoaned the sale to an American, saying: &#x201c;The acquisition will confirm MoMA&#x2019;s dominance as the leading gallery of modern art in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>* * *<br><br>I began the journey of discovery that became this book at the Royal Academy of Arts in London where on October 5, 2006, along with six hundred others, I attended a private preview of <i>USA Today</i>, an exhibition curated by the same Charles Saatchi. This was billed as an exhibition of art by thirty-seven talented young American artists. Many were not in fact American-born, though they were working in New York &#x2013; an illustration of how hard it is to label an artist.<br><br>The Royal Academy is a major British public gallery. Founded in 1768, it promotes its exhibitions as comparable to those at the National Gallery, the two Tate galleries, and leading museums outside the United Kingdom. The <i>USA Today</i> show was not a commercial art fair, because nothing was listed as for sale. Nor was it a traditional museum show, because one man, Charles Saatchi, owned all the work. He chose what was shown. The work would appreciate in value from being shown in such a prestigious public space, and all profit from future sales would accrue to Saatchi.<br><br>Saatchi is neither a professional curator nor museum official. Over a four-decade career he has been both the most talked-about advertising executive of his generation, and later the most talked-about art collector. He is wildly successful in reselling art he has collected at a profit, Damien Hirst&#x2019;s shark being but one example.<br><br>There was criticism of Saatchi both for using the Royal Academy to advance the value of his own art, and because some considered the work decadent or pornographic. The artists present at the opening had no illusions about the nature of the event. One called the Royal Academy the &#x201c;temporary home of the Saatchi Gallery.&#x201d; Another said it was good to see his art on the wall because it might not be displayed again until it was offered at auction.<br><br>Extensive promotion of the show produced huge press coverage. It was hyped pre-opening by every major newspaper in London, by the<i> New York Times</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and a dozen other major U.S. papers. Billed as an exhibition of shocking work, the show included a battle scene involving rats, and an image of a girl performing a sex act on a man.<br><br>The theme of <i>USA Today</i> was billed as disillusionment with contemporary America. Critics and curators at the private opening had diverging opinions of the theme and the work. Some questioned whether the artists could properly be described as disillusioned, or even talented. Norman Rosenthal, the Royal Academy&#x2019;s exhibitions secretary, said the work &#x201c;introduces a sense of political edge and anger mixed with nostalgia; this is an exhibition for our times.&#x201d; Critic Brian Sewell said: &#x201c;At least <i>Sensation</i> [Saatchi&#x2019;s previous exhibition] made me feel nauseous. This made me feel nothing.&#x201d; Ivor Abrahams, a sculptor who sits on the RA exhibitions committee, added: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s schoolboy smut and a cynical ploy to get Saatchi even more noticed.&#x201d; Such is the range of opinion common to contemporary art. Saatchi&#x2019;s own contribution was: &#x201c;Please be my guest at <i>USA Today</i>, and leave me a note if you think that anything there is truly more tasteless than so much we see around us every day.&#x201d;<br><br>The next day the show opened to the general public. Ticket holders shuffled through the galleries in near silence, emotions muted. The crowd looked as if it was queuing to sign the condolence book before Princess Diana&#x2019;s funeral. As is true with much contemporary art, no one seemed anxious to admit they neither understood nor liked what was being shown. At the end people filed out, talking softly, absorbing the experience, neither pleased nor shocked.<br><br>What kind of contemporary art did Charles Saatchi choose for the show? Jonathan Pylpchuk from Winnipeg, Canada showed a miniature army camp containing black American GIs with amputated legs &#x2013; some writhing, others dead. The title is<i> Hopefully, I Will Live Through This With a Little Bit of Dignity</i>. Beijing-born and Vancouver-raised Terence Koh&#x2019;s <i>CRACKHEAD</i> is a death fantasy of 222 glass vitrines with distorted black heads in plaster, paint, and wax, for which Saatchi said he had paid $200,000. Koh also offered a neon rooster titled <i>Big White Cock</i>.<br><br>French artist Jules de Balincourt&#x2019;s <i>US World Studies II</i> is a map showing the United States upside down, with the Mississippi River dividing Democratic states on the left from Republican states on the right. The rest of the world, in small scale, is at the bottom of the map. An artist actually born in New York and improbably named Dash Snow, offered a work called <i>F*** the Police</i>, which consists of a collage of forty-five newspaper clippings discussing police misdeeds, over which the artist had sprayed semen &#x2013; his own presumably. Twenty-five-year-old Snow already had achieved earlier notoriety in the New York City art community for running a graffiti gang called Irak, and for performance art called <i>The Hamster&#x2019;s Nest</i>, which involved naked girls and hundreds of shredded phone books.<br><br>By consensus, the most offensive work was Pakistani artist Huma Bhabha&#x2019;s wire figure with a primitive tail, dressed in a black garbage bag with outstretched arms and positioned in what seemed to be the Islamic prayer position (illustrated). Bhabha, forty five, makes sculptures of found materials which are, she says, about the human condition. Her work at <i>USA Today</i> seemed at first glance to be half-man, half-rat. However, critic Waldemar Januszczak said in the <i>Sunday Times</i> (London), &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one likely reading of this work . . . as a religious specimen in which evolution has gone into reverse. Hence the tail.&#x201d;<br><br>Judging art is supposed to have less to do with the content of a work and more to do with an instinctive sense for what the artist has to say. Kirsten Ward, who is a physician and psychologist, says that art has the greatest impact when it makes the thinking part of the brain talk to the feeling part. Great work speaks clearly, while more trivial work does what critics call &#x201c;going dead.&#x201d; The experienced art collector will take a work home before buying it, to look at it several times a day. The question is whether a week or a month hence, after the novelty disappears, the message and painter&#x2019;s skill will still be apparent.<br><br>Dealer prices for the work shown by Saatchi ranged from $30,000 to $600,000. For the 105 pieces the total was about $7.8 million. Saatchi probably paid half that, because he is a high profile collector, and because the work was to be shown in a prestigious museum. Display at the Royal Academy would likely double the original retail value of each work, in which case the paper profit to Saatchi from the show was about $11.7 million. Saatchi is thought to have contributed about �2 million to pay for mounting the show.<br><br>So what was the significance of<i> USA Today</i>? Did the show reflect the reality of twenty-first century contemporary art, or just Charles Saatchi&#x2019;s preference for shock art? Did these works deserve to be shown in a major museum, in some cases only weeks after they were created? Jerry Saltz of the <i>Village Voice</i> offers a rule of thumb: 85 percent of new contemporary art is bad. Most of the art world agree with the percentage, but disagree on how any particular work should be ranked.<br><br>As an economist and contemporary art collector, I have long been puzzled by what makes a particular work of art valuable, and by what alchemy it is seen as worth $12 million or $100 million rather than say, $250,000. Works sometimes sell for a hundred times what seems a reasonable sum, but why? Dealers and auction house specialists do not claim to be able to identify or define what will become million-dollar contemporary art. They say publicly that prices are whatever someone will pay, and privately that art buying at the most expensive end is often a game played by the super-rich, with publicity and cultural distinction as the prize. That may be a good description of motivation, but it does not explain the process.<br>* This and prices that follow in the book are quoted in the currency of the original transaction. As a rough average over the periods involved, assume that $1.00 equals &#x20ac;.77 or �.55.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Downfall</h2><p>From the Eisner-nominated, best-selling author of <i>Goodnight Punpun</i> and <i>solanin</i>, a dark look at what happens when living the life of your dreams becomes your downfall.<br><br>Selling copies is the only thing that matters.<br> <br>So what if your first series just ended and you have no idea how to start the next one, your marriage is breaking up, your pure love of manga has been destroyed by the cruel reality of the industry and nothing seems to fill the sucking void inside you...<br> <br>Find the secret combo for a new hit manga series and everything will be okay.<br> <br>Right?</p><p>Inio Asano, a bona fide earthling, was born in Ibaraki Japan in 1980.

Through the slats on the window shades, the first murky hint of dawn slipped, slanting shadowy bars over the bed. It was like waking in a cell.</p><p>For a moment she simply lay there, shuddering, imprisoned, while the dream faded. After ten years on the force, Eve still had dreams.</p><p>Six hours before, she&#x2019;d killed a man, had watched death creep into his eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time she&#x2019;d exercised maximum force, or dreamed. She&#x2019;d learned to accept the action and the consequences.</p><p>But it was the child that haunted her. The child she hadn&#x2019;t been in time to save. The child whose screams had echoed in the dreams with her own.</p><p>All the blood, Eve thought, scrubbing sweat from her face with her hands. Such a small little girl to have had so much blood in her. And she knew it was vital that she push it aside.</p><p>Standard departmental procedure meant that she would spend the morning in Testing. Any officer whose discharge of weapon resulted in termination of life was required to undergo emotional and psychiatric clearance before resuming duty. Eve considered the tests a mild pain in the ass.</p><p>She would beat them, as she&#x2019;d beaten them before.</p><p>When she rose, the overheads went automatically to low setting, lighting her way into the bath. She winced once at her reflection. Her eyes were swollen from lack of sleep, her skin nearly as pale as the corpses she&#x2019;d delegated to the ME.</p><p>Rather than dwell on it, she stepped into the shower, yawning.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me one oh one degrees, full force,&#x201d; she said and shifted so that the shower spray hit her straight in the face.</p><p>She let it steam, lathered listlessly while she played through the events of the night before. She wasn&#x2019;t due in Testing until nine, and would use the next three hours to settle and let the dream fade away completely.</p><p>Small doubts and little regrets were often detected and could mean a second and more intense round with the machines and the owl-eyed technicians who ran them.</p><p>Eve didn&#x2019;t intend to be off the streets longer than twenty-four hours.</p><p>After pulling on a robe, she walked into the kitchen and programmed her AutoChef for coffee, black; toast, light. Through her window she could hear the heavy hum of air traffic carrying early commuters to offices, late ones home. She&#x2019;d chosen the apartment years before because it was in a heavy ground and air pattern, and she liked the noise and crowds. On another yawn, she glanced out the window, followed the rattling journey of an aging airbus hauling laborers not fortunate enough to work in the city or by home-links.</p><p>She brought the <i>New York Times</i> up on her monitor and scanned the headlines while the faux caffeine bolstered her system. The AutoChef had burned her toast again, but she ate it anyway, with a vague thought of springing for a replacement unit.</p><p>She was frowning over an article on a mass recall of droid cocker spaniels when her tele-link blipped. Eve shifted to communications and watched her commanding officer flash onto the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d; He gave her a brisk nod, noted the still wet hair and sleepy eyes. &#x201c;Incident at Twenty-seven West Broadway, eighteenth floor.

Code Five, lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; His face flashed off even as she pushed back from the screen. Code Five meant she would report directly to her commander, and there would be no unsealed interdepartmental reports and no cooperation with the press.</p><p>In essence, it meant she was on her own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Broadway was noisy and crowded, a party where rowdy guests never left. Street, pedestrian, and sky traffic were miserable, choking the air with bodies and vehicles. In her old days in uniform she remembered it as a hot spot for wrecks and crushed tourists who were too busy gaping at the show to get out of the way.</p><p>Even at this hour there was steam rising from the stationary and portable food stands that offered everything from rice noodles to soydogs for the teeming crowds. She had to swerve to avoid an eager merchant on his smoking Glida-Grill, and took his flipped middle finger as a matter of course.</p><p>Eve double-parked and, skirting a man who smelled worse than his bottle of brew, stepped onto the sidewalk. She scanned the building first, fifty floors of gleaming metal that knifed into the sky from a hilt of concrete. She was propositioned twice before she reached the door.</p><p>Since this five-block area of Broadway was affectionately termed Prostitute&#x2019;s Walk, she wasn&#x2019;t surprised. She flashed her badge for the uniform guarding the entrance.</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He skimmed his official compu-seal over the door to keep out the curious, then led the way to the bank of elevators. &#x201c;Eighteenth floor,&#x201d; he said when the doors swished shut behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill me in, officer.&#x201d; Eve switched on her recorder and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t first on the scene, lieutenant. Whatever happened upstairs is being kept upstairs. There&#x2019;s a badge inside waiting for you. We have a Homicide, and a Code Five in number Eighteen-oh-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who called it in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have that information.&#x201d;</p><p>He stayed where he was when the elevator opened. Eve stepped out and was alone in a narrow hallway. Security cameras tilted down at her and her feet were almost soundless on the worn nap of the carpet as she approached 1803. Ignoring the handplate, she announced herself, holding her badge up to eye level for the peep cam until the door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feeney.&#x201d; She smiled, pleased to see a familiar face. Ryan Feeney was an old friend and former partner who&#x2019;d traded the street for a desk and a top level position in the Electronics Detection Division. &#x201c;So, they&#x2019;re sending computer pluckers these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They wanted brass, and the best.&#x201d; His lips curved in his wide, rumpled face, but his eyes remained sober. He was a small, stubby man with small, stubby hands and rust colored hair. &#x201c;You look beat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rough night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I heard.&#x201d; He offered her one of the sugared nuts from the bag he habitually carried, studying her, and measuring if she was up to what was waiting in the bedroom beyond.</p><p>She was young for her rank, barely thirty, with wide brown eyes that had never had a chance to be naive. Her doe-brown hair was cropped short, for convenience rather than style, but suited her triangular face with its razor-edge cheekbones and slight dent in the chin.</p><p>She was tall, rangy, with a tendency to look thin, but Feeney knew there were solid muscles beneath the leather jacket. More, there was a brain, and a heart.</p><p>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s going to be touchy, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I picked that up already. Who&#x2019;s the victim?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sharon DeBlass, granddaughter of Senator DeBlass.&#x201d;</p><p>Neither meant anything to her. &#x201c;Politics isn&#x2019;t my forte, Feeney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The gentleman from Virginia, extreme right, old money. The granddaughter took a sharp left a few years back, moved to New York, and became a licensed companion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was a hooker.&#x201d; Dallas glanced around the apartment. It was furnished in obsessive modern&#x2014;glass and thin chrome, signed holograms on the walls, recessed bar in bold red. The wide mood screen behind the bar bled with mixing and merging shapes and colors in cool pastels.</p><p>Neat as a virgin, Eve mused, and cold as a whore. &#x201c;No surprise, given her choice of real estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Politics makes it delicate. Victim was twenty-four, Caucasian female. She bought it in bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve only lifted a brow. &#x201c;Seems poetic, since she&#x2019;d been bought there. How&#x2019;d she die?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the next problem. I want you to see for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>As they crossed the room, each took out a slim container, sprayed their hands front and back to seal in oils and fingerprints. At the doorway, Eve sprayed the bottom of her boots to slicken them so that she would pick up no fibers, stray hairs, or skin.</p><p>Eve was already wary. Under normal circumstances there would have been two other investigators on a homicide scene, with recorders for sound and pictures. Forensics would have been waiting with their usual snarly impatience to sweep the scene.</p><p>The fact that only Feeney had been assigned with her meant that there were a lot of eggshells to be walked over.</p><p>&#x201c;Security cameras in the lobby, elevator, and hallways,&#x201d; Eve commented.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already tagged the discs.&#x201d; Feeney opened the bedroom door and let her enter first.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t pretty. Death rarely was a peaceful, religious experience to Eve&#x2019;s mind. It was the nasty end, indifferent to saint and sinner. But this was shocking, like a stage deliberately set to offend.</p><p>The bed was huge, slicked with what appeared to be genuine satin sheets the color of ripe peaches. Small, soft focused spotlights were trained on its center where the naked woman was cupped in the gentle dip of the floating mattress.</p><p>The mattress moved with obscenely graceful undulations to the rhythm of programmed music slipping through the headboard.</p><p>She was beautiful still, a cameo face with a tumbling waterfall of flaming red hair, emerald eyes that stared glassily at the mirrored ceiling, long, milk white limbs that called to mind visions of <i>Swan Lake</i> as the motion of the bed gently rocked them.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t artistically arranged now, but spread lewdly so that the dead woman formed a final X dead center of the bed.</p><p>There was a hole in her forehead, one in her chest, another horribly gaping between the open thighs. Blood had splattered on the glossy sheets, pooled, dripped, and stained.</p><p>There were splashes of it on the lacquered walls, like lethal paintings scrawled by an evil child.</p><p>So much blood was a rare thing, and she had seen much too much of it the night before to take the scene as calmly as she would have preferred.</p><p>She had to swallow once, hard, and force herself to block out the image of a small child.</p><p>&#x201c;You got the scene on record?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then turn that damn thing off.&#x201d; She let out a breath after Feeney located the controls that silenced the music. The bed flowed to stillness. &#x201c;The wounds,&#x201d; Eve murmured, stepping closer to examine them. &#x201c;Too neat for a knife. Too messy for a laser.&#x201d; A flash came to her&#x2014;old training films, old videos, old viciousness.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, Feeney, these look like bullet wounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Feeney reached into his pocket and drew out a sealed bag. &#x201c;Whoever did it left a souvenir.&#x201d; He passed the bag to Eve. &#x201c;An antique like this has to go for eight, ten thousand for a legal collection, twice that on the black market.&#x201d;</p><p>Fascinated, Eve turned the sealed revolver over in her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s heavy,&#x201d; she said half to herself. &#x201c;Bulky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty-eight caliber,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;First one I&#x2019;ve seen outside of a museum. This one&#x2019;s a Smith &amp; Wesson, Model Ten, blue steel.&#x201d; He looked at it with some affection. &#x201c;Real classic piece, used to be standard police issue up until the latter part of the twentieth. They stopped making them in about twenty-two, twenty-three, when the gun ban was passed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the history buff.&#x201d; Which explained why he was with her. &#x201c;Looks new.&#x201d; She sniffed through the bag, caught the scent of oil and burning. &#x201c;Somebody took good care of this. Steel fired into flesh,&#x201d; she mused as she passed the bag back to Feeney. &#x201c;Ugly way to die, and the first I&#x2019;ve seen it in my ten years with the department.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Second for me. About fifteen years ago, Lower East Side, party got out of hand. Guy shot five people with a twenty-two before he realized it wasn&#x2019;t a toy. Hell of a mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fun and games,&#x201d; Eve murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll scan the collectors, see how many we can locate who own one like this. Somebody might have reported a robbery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more likely it came through the black market.&#x201d; Eve glanced back at the body. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s been in the business for a few years, she&#x2019;d have discs, records of her clients, her trick books.&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;With Code Five, I&#x2019;ll have to do the door-to-door myself. Not a simple sex crime,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;Whoever did it set it up. The antique weapon, the wounds themselves, almost ruler straight down the body, the lights, the pose. Who called it in, Feeney?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The killer.&#x201d; He waited until her eyes came back to him. &#x201c;From right here. Called the station. See how the bedside unit&#x2019;s aimed at her face? That&#x2019;s what came in. Video, no audio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s into showmanship.&#x201d; Eve let out a breath. &#x201c;Clever bastard, arrogant, cocky. He had sex with her first. I&#x2019;d bet my badge on it. Then he gets up and does it.&#x201d; She lifted her arm, aiming, lowering it as she counted off, &#x201c;One, two, three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; murmured Feeney.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cold. He smooths down the sheets after. See how neat they are? He arranges her, spreads her open so nobody can have any doubts as to how she made her living. He does it carefully, practically measuring, so that she&#x2019;s perfectly aligned. Center of the bed, arms and legs equally apart. Doesn&#x2019;t turn off the bed &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s part of the show. He leaves the gun because he wants us to know right away he&#x2019;s no ordinary man. He&#x2019;s got an ego. He doesn&#x2019;t want to waste time letting the body be discovered eventually. He wants it now. That instant gratification.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was licensed for men and women,&#x201d; Feeney pointed out, but Eve shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a woman. A woman wouldn&#x2019;t have left her looking both beautiful and obscene. No, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a woman. Let&#x2019;s see what we can find. Have you gone into her computer yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s your case, Dallas. I&#x2019;m only authorized to assist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See if you can access her client files.&#x201d; Eve went to the dresser and began to carefully search drawers.</p><p>Expensive taste, Eve reflected. There were several items of real silk, the kind no simulation could match. The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive, and smelled, after a quick sniff, like expensive sex.</p><p>The contents of the drawers were meticulously ordered, lingerie folded precisely, sweaters arranged according to color and material. The closet was the same.</p><p>Obviously the victim had a love affair with clothes and a taste for the best and took scrupulous care of what she owned.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d died naked.</p><p>&#x201c;Kept good records,&#x201d; Feeney called out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all here. Her client list, appointments&#x2014;including her required monthly health exam and her weekly trip to the beauty salon. She used the Trident Clinic for the first and Paradise for the second.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Both top of the line. I&#x2019;ve got a friend who saved for a year so she could have one day for the works at Paradise. Takes all kinds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s sister went for it for her twenty-fifth anniversary. Cost damn near as much as my kid&#x2019;s wedding. Hello, we&#x2019;ve got her personal address book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.

And her message is consistent--calling people into a personal relationship with God through His Word.&nbsp;</p>'Bryant's cheerful watercolor illustrations imagine Heaven as a sort of pleasant amusement park with Jesus as the headmaster and where children ride on the backs of flying sheep and climb trees with pigs and frogs. The final pages present a conservative Christian philosophy of confession and acceptance of Jesus as one's personal savior, with the concluding pages offering a prayer for children and the relevant verses from the Book of John. Additional materials include an explanatory letter to parents and other adults, questions for adults to use with children, Bible verse references incorporated into the text and an 'RSVP to Jesus' for use by the child reader. Though the text is on the saccharine side and the heavenly interpretation is a bit far-fetched, this effort does serve as an accessible introduction to difficult concepts.' - Kirkus Review (<i>Kirkus Review</i>)<br><br>'Bryant&#x2019;s child-friendly watercolor artwork, with its sense of joy, is the best part of the book. Lotz&#x2019; text is singsongy and does not always scan well: &#x201c;I have a little brother / he&#x2019;s as cute as he can be. We do everything together / and he always looks up to me.&#x201d; Still, parents looking for a Christian-centered book on heaven will like the message, which the book notes &#x201c;is not imagination or fantasy. It is God&#x2019;s promised word&#x201d; (John 14:1&#x2013;6 and Revelation 21&#x2013;27 are cited).

A boy narrator states he likes the contents of a special box at his grandmother's house. Turn the page and there is a box of buttons--no words--just buttons. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. The boy describes various buttons, telling what he imagines and knows about them--that some came from shoes or from his grandfather's pants. A brief history of buttons appears in the back. A story about buttons just isn't much of a story, and the grocery-store quality illustrations in dull, lifeless watercolors without detail or depth don't help.

Attributed to Sun Tzu of the Zhou dynasty, the book is composed of thirteen chapters, each addressing a particular aspect of warfare, such as planning offenses, military combat, and the employment of spies. Influential in eastern civilization for millennia and in western culture since its first translation in the 18th century, the teachings of this book have been applied to scenarios as varied as office politics, the Vietnam War, and American football. Now this living military heirloom is available as part of the Word Cloud Classics series in a chic affordable edition for readers everywhere.</p><p><i>The Art of War</i> is the Swiss army knife of military theory--pop out a different tool for any situation. Folded into this small package are compact views on resourcefulness, momentum, cunning, the profit motive, flexibility, integrity, secrecy, speed, positioning, surprise, deception, manipulation, responsibility, and practicality. Thomas Cleary's translation keeps the package tight, with crisp language and short sections. Commentaries from the Chinese tradition trail Sun-tzu's words, elaborating and picking up on puzzling lines. Take the solitary passage: "Do not eat food for their soldiers." Elsewhere, Sun-tzu has told us to plunder the enemy's stores, but now we're not supposed to eat the food? The Tang dynasty commentator Du Mu solves the puzzle nicely, "If the enemy suddenly abandons their food supplies, they should be tested first before eating, lest they be poisoned." Most passages, however, are the pinnacle of succinct clarity: "Lure them in with the prospect of gain, take them by confusion" or "Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent." Sun-tzu's maxims are widely applicable beyond the military because they speak directly to the exigencies of survival. Your new tools will serve you well, but don't flaunt them. Remember Sun-tzu's advice: "Though effective, appear to be ineffective." <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Here is a seminal work on the philosophy of successful leadership that is as applicable to contemporary business as it is to war. James Clavell has taken a 1910 translation and clarified it for the contemporary reader.</p><h2>Pediatric Physical Examination: An Illustrated Handbook</h2><p><p>Known for its accuracy, consistency, and portability, <b>Pediatric Physical Examination: An Illustrated Handbook, 3rd Edition</b> teaches the unique range of skills needed to assess children of all ages.

She and her husband, bestselling author/illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi, reside with their daughter in Amherst, Massachusetts.<br><br>Brendan Wenzel&#x2019;s artwork often explores the natural world and our relationship to it and he has teamed up with many groups working to preserve wild places and creatures around the world.&nbsp; He has illustrated several acclaimed animal-themed picture books, including <i>Some Bugs</i> and <i>Some Pets</i> by Angela DiTerlizzi, <i>Beastly Babies</i> by Ellen Jackson, and his own <i>They All Saw a Cat</i>. He lives in New York.Children and animals mingle at a pet show in this picture book. Variety is on full display in this second collaboration by DiTerlizzi and Wenzel. Their first, Some Bugs (2014),had its reveal at the end of the story. In this, the reveal comes first, as the double-spread title page shows a city park hosting a busy pet show. The illustrations that follow&#x2014;all double-page spreads&#x2014;are scenes pulled out and amplified from this beginning overview. DiTerlizzi's spare, rhyming words give structure to Wenzel's kaleidoscopic illustrations, which in their turn amply adorn the minimalist text. The plot is a celebration of diversity, both human and animal,as everyone cavorts and cuddles. The idea of animals sharing space with humans in a human-created habitat is a nice one, and a note from the creators at the end emphasizes the commitment needed for responsible pet ownership.... Author: Kirkus Reviews<br><br>This bright and bouncy story in verse is about an array of pets and what they do. &#x201c;Some pets slither. Some pets bound. Some pets scurry round and round.&#x201d; Verbs describe how pets move, how they make sounds, how they eat, and how they show affection to their owners. The story ends with a statement about what all pets have in common. Humorous illustrations flesh out the simple text with mixed-media art that includes lots of cut-paper collage and what appear to be googly eyes. The bright, colorful illustrations are at their best when showing animals dressed for a costume party. Readers will have many observations about the animals in this story, as well as comments about their own pets or other animals they have known. Encourage young readers to find a word to describe how their pets move, make sounds, eat, or show affection, and, if appropriate, discuss the difference between nouns and verbs. VERDICT This fun, lively book will entertain kids at storytime, but it is also a simple way to begin discussing parts of speech. Recommended for all collections.

Bob patrols the theological borders of this book like a trusty doberman who won&#x2019;t allow you to trespass into unhealthy attitudes and approaches in worship. But for all the <em>patrolling</em>, there&#x2019;s even more <em>pastoring</em>. As you read the pages of this book, be open to the whispers of the Holy Spirit. Be ready for him to guide you, remind you, re-align you, or surprise you&#x2015;for your greater good and his greater glory.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Matt Redman,</strong>&nbsp;recording artist; songwriter; worship leader, Brighton</p><p>&#x201c;Brilliant.

It goes beyond our sanctuaries and stages, but it always starts with God. And it always starts with our hearts. I am grateful for Bob Kauflin&#x2019;s refreshing honesty and humility as he shares from his experience. This book will be my first recommendation for those wanting to lead worship, as well as anyone seeking to deepen his or her relationship with God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Lauren Chandler,</strong> writer; speaker; singer; wife of Matt Chandler, The Village Church, Flower Mound, Texas</p><p>&#x201c;Bob Kauflin helps us prepare here and now for what we will spend an eternity doing in heaven&#x2015;worshiping in spirit and in truth the One seated on the throne, singing the song of the Lamb.

He is concerned above all for the heart&#x2015;for the depth and authenticity of our relationship with God&#x2015;which so often gets lost in the controversies over styles and traditions. I profited from this book, and in it Bob challenged the quality of my worship.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John M. Frame,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy Emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;With simplicity and clarity, Bob Kauflin tackles issues he has seen Christians struggle with in the years he has been a pastor, many of which relate to our gatherings. Bob confronts misconceptions about worship in an engaging way, relating everything to Scripture and incorporating helpful insights from other writers. Here is a book to put into the hands of any believer who is searching for answers about this vitally important topic.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Peterson,</strong>&nbsp;Former Principal, Oak Hill College; Senior Research Fellow and Lecturer in New Testament, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;At a time when we so casually label all manner of products, conferences, and ministries with the adjective &#x2018;worship,&#x2019; Bob&#x2019;s clear, practical, inspiring, and thoroughly biblical book brings us back to the heart of what is means to be a worshiper of God. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stuart Townend,</strong> Christian songwriter</p><p>&#x201c;I am so thankful for the guidance Bob Kauflin gives us in <em>True Worshipers</em>. Bob writes as a pastor who understands what&#x2019;s at stake when we talk about worship, connecting our practices as the church gathered to the much bigger, all-of-life reality of worship. <em>True Worshipers</em> is a book for all Christians who want to deepen their practices as worshipers and deepen their intimacy with God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mike Cosper, </strong>Founder and Director, Harbor Institute for Faith and Culture</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s sad but true: while few things are more fundamental in our lives than worship, few things are more misunderstood. What <em>Worship Matters</em> did for worship leaders <em>True Worshipers</em> does for the rest of us&#x2015;it draws our attention to what is most important when we think about worship. As a pastor, I&#x2019;m grateful for the role this book will play in cultivating true worship in our church. As a Christian, I&#x2019;m grateful this book challenges me to live my entire life delighting in, exalting, and serving the Savior. And as Bob&#x2019;s friend for the past four decades, I can tell you he is a compelling example of what is written on every page of this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>C.J.

The reservation clerk for Highland Airlines glanced up nervously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but I can&#x2019;t sell you a ticket to Seattle. If you&#x2019;d kindly step aside and wait a few minutes&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t?&#x201d; Ashley cut in, growing more frustrated and worried by the minute. She drew in a deep breath in an effort to control her patience. The woman behind the desk, whose name tag identified her as Stephanie, was clearly having a bad day. Getting upset with her, Ashley realized, wasn&#x2019;t going to help the situation. She made a determined effort to lower her voice and remain cool-�headed.<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m sorry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Ashley refused to take no for an answer. Surprising her mother by flying home for Christmas was too important. &#x201c;I understand getting a ticket to Seattle three days before Christmas is pushing my luck,&#x201d; she said, doing her best to appear calm and composed. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d been able to book a seat sooner, I would have. Getting Christmas off from work was a complete surprise. I attend graduate school and I also work at a diner. I hated to miss the holidays with my mother, but I didn&#x2019;t have any choice. She&#x2019;s a widow and my brother lives in Texas and can&#x2019;t get home for Christmas, so there&#x2019;s only me.&#x201d; Perhaps if the reservation clerk knew her story, she might reconsider the can&#x2019;t sell you a ticket part of this discussion.<br><br>&#x201c;Then my boss decided to close the diner between Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s for renovations after the refrigeration unit broke, and then he thought he may as well get a new deep fryer, too, so it just made sense to close down. All this happened at the very last minute, and because he felt so bad he gave me a Christmas bonus so I could fly home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry . . .&#x201d; Stephanie said again, looking nervous. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d kindly move aside and wait a few minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen my mother since last August,&#x201d; Ashley continued, refusing to give up easily. &#x201c;I wanted to surprise her. It would mean the world to both of us to be together over the holidays. Would you please look again? I&#x2019;ll take any seat, any time of the day or night.&#x201d;<br><br>Stephanie didn&#x2019;t so much as glance down at her computer screen with even a pretense of trying to accommodate her. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t . . . I wish I could, but I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Ashley couldn&#x2019;t help wonder what was up with this can&#x2019;t business. That made it all the more nonsensical.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;There must be more of an explanation than that. It just doesn&#x2019;t make sense.&#x201d;<br><br>The reservation clerk frowned. Her eyes roamed about the area as if she was looking for someone. That, too, was irritating. It was as if she was seeking a replacement or someone to rescue her.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe you have your answer,&#x201d; the man behind her in line said impatiently. He shifted from one foot to the other, letting Ashley know he didn&#x2019;t appreciate her arguing with the clerk.<br><br>Ashley whirled around and confronted him face-�to-�face. &#x201c;In case anyone forgot to mention it, this is Christmas. How about a little peace on earth and goodwill toward men? Be patient. I&#x2019;ll be finished as soon as possible and then you can talk to Stephanie, but for now it&#x2019;s my turn.&#x201d;<br><br>In response, he rolled his eyes.<br><br>Ashley returned her attention to the woman at the counter. &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t find me a seat on a plane to Seattle, I&#x2019;d be willing to fly standby.&#x201d;<br><br>Stephanie shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;All the flights to Seattle are already booked?&#x201d; The man next in line blurted out the question.<br><br>Stephanie&#x2019;s eyes widened as if she, too, was surprised he&#x2019;d jumped into their conversation. &#x201c;I . . . didn&#x2019;t say that. I&#x2019;ll speak to you directly in just a moment,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Ashley flared, forgetting her resolve to remain calm and collected. This was too much. With her hands on her hips, she stared down at the other woman. &#x201c;This is discrimination. Just because he&#x2019;s a man and good-�looking you can dredge up a seat for him, but not for me?&#x201d; This was gender discrimination. Where was a television crew when you needed one? This would make a juicy piece for the six-�o&#x2019;clock news.<br><br>Seeing that the line was getting long and the Grinch behind her wasn&#x2019;t the only one with a short fuse, Ashley decided to drop the entire matter.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, fine, have it your way, but I think this is just plain wrong.&#x201d; With that, she grabbed hold of her suitcase and with all the dignity she could muster started to walk away, feeling more stressed with each step.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss, miss,&#x201d; the airline employee called after her. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d kindly wait a few minutes I&#x2019;m sure we could resolve this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Ashley refused. &#x201c;As you&#x2019;ve repeatedly said, you can&#x2019;t sell me a ticket.&#x201d; With that, she headed out of the airport with her dignity in shreds.<br><br>Ashley hadn&#x2019;t expected it would be easy to catch a last-�minute flight. She&#x2019;d already tried to find an available seat online, without luck. For reasons she couldn&#x2019;t understand she kept getting booted off the website. That was the reason she&#x2019;d decided to come directly to the airport and try her chances there.<br><br>Naturally, flying home was her first option. But other modes of transportation were also possibilities. She could always try the bus or travel by train, if there was even one scheduled. The most expedient way to make the trip would be to drive. Unfortunately, her fifteen-�year-�old hand-�me-�down car wasn&#x2019;t in the best of shape and she was afraid of it breaking down along the way. To top it off, snow was predicted. Under normal circumstances, snow close to Christmas would be ideal, but not in an aging vehicle. If she could afford . . .<br><br>Ashley stopped mid-�step. Why hadn&#x2019;t she thought of this earlier? She could always rent a car! The solution was right in front of her, the answer obvious. She should have thought about it long before now. And really there was no better place to rent a car than in an airport.<br><br>Perfect.<br><br>Reversing direction, Ashley headed toward the car rental agencies, traveling down the escalator, rolling her suitcase behind her. When she reached the rental area, all of the agencies displayed signs that stated all their cars had been rented. All but one. Ashley made her way to that counter.<br><br>The longer she waited in line, the more she fumed about the airline clerk who&#x2019;d insisted she couldn&#x2019;t sell her a seat. The nerve. And then to basically reassure the man in line behind her that there were seats available. That was discrimination of the worst kind, even if the guy was eye candy. Stephanie was clearly looking to do him a favor, which only served to irritate Ashley further. Truth be told, she&#x2019;d noticed him, too. Hard not to, really. He was tall and stood with military precision, his dark appearance lean and strong. She suspected he was either military or former military. He gave that impression.<br><br>The line for the car rental agency slowly crept forward. As luck would have it, the very man who&#x2019;d been so annoying at the airline counter came to stand behind her again.<br><br>It gave Ashley satisfaction to see he hadn&#x2019;t been any more successful with Stephanie in obtaining a seat than she had.<br><br>&#x201c;So Stephanie couldn&#x2019;t sell you a seat, either,&#x201d; she said, trying hard not to gloat.<br><br>&#x201c;All she had available was standby,&#x201d; he grumbled, fingering his cell.<br><br>Ashley would have gladly accepted a chance for a standby flight. It wouldn&#x2019;t have mattered how long she had to wait. &#x201c;Not good enough for you, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>He glanced her way and frowned, his look darkening. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take the chance. I need to be in Seattle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do, too,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is for a job interview.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A job?&#x201d; Ashley echoed. &#x201c;And you have to be there right before Christmas?&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of answering, he returned his attention to his phone, frowning once again. Apparently he wasn&#x2019;t interested in making conversation with her. Fine. Whatever. That being the case, she wasn&#x2019;t interested in talking to him, either.</p><h2>Maid-sama!

She was sick of watching the world go by without her. She should be outside, exploring the neighborhood and researching the local wildlife, but she was stuck inside. And it was her own fault.<br> <br> <br> <br>Their first week in San Francisco, Ada had attempted a bungee jump from a eucalyptus tree in the park. It was a jump she could have made with no bungee. The bungee was capable of stretching 50 percent of its length with her attached to it, but the branch was barely high enough to make the line taut. It was a careless mistake.<br> <br>While Ada was brooding, her mom came in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think you might come have breakfast with me before I go?&#x201d; her mother asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess so. I was hoping we could skip the good-bye part,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll only be gone for a few days,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;These artists need a little bit of handholding. They aren&#x2019;t as tough as you are. I&#x2019;ll be back in time for your first day at school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada attempted a smile and, on her crutches, followed her mom down the stairs only to be nearly flattened by her brother, Elliott, outside the kitchen. He was wearing an eyepatch and a vest. A stuffed parrot hung lamely from his shoulder. Ada had been reading Treasure Island with Elliott. Now Elliott was determined to find buried treasure. Until then he was dressing the part.<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy there, mate,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;You almost capsized your sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yarr!&#x201d; said Elliott. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s &#x2018;Captain&#x2019; to you. Get that straight, lady, or you&#x2019;ll walk the plank!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tone it down, Elliott, or you&#x2019;ll spend the weekend in your room,&#x201d; said Ms. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, me lady,&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do I have to make you swab the poop deck, Elliott?&#x201d; asked Mr. Lace. He placed a plate of French toast in front of Ada. It had crossed eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Pop,&#x201d; said Ada. It was hard to stay grumpy around her dad.<br> <br>&#x201c;This blasted parrot won&#x2019;t sit!&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to secure his tail feathers.&#x201d; Ada wrapped the string around the parrot&#x2019;s tail and feet then tied it. &#x201c;That requires a square knot. What you had was a granny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Arrgh! There ye be, Ruffles. Good bird,&#x201d; said Elliott.<br> <br> <br> <br>&#x201c;Ada, do you remember that lady we met at the farmer&#x2019;s market? Glenda?&#x201d; asked Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;Her daughter&#x2019;s about your age. They live over on Polymer Street. You should get together with her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And do what, jump rope?&#x201d; said Ada, looking down at her cast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very funny,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. &#x201c;How about you have her over?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada shrugged. She wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to entertain.<br> <br>&#x201c;It would give you a head start on being the new kid,&#x201d; said Ada&#x2019;s mom. She stood, stuffing one last piece of bacon in her mouth. &#x201c;Just think about it. I&#x2019;ll leave the phone number.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kay,&#x201d; said Ada. Her mom gave her a kiss on the cheek. Ms. Lace hugged her husband and her son and collected her bags.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bon voyage!&#x201d; yelled Elliott. &#x201c;Bring me back some gold!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada&#x2019;s mom squatted beside Ada&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;Cheer up, sweet pea.

It is about a specific previously undisclosed discovery that has not received any attention in the media or by academic peer groups. It involves the development of what has become known as &#x201c;Nikola Tesla&#x2019;s Positive Purple Energy Plates&#x201d; which when worn or carried by an individual, or placed in their close proximity (such as in a home, office or car) can have multiple positive benefits that some consider &#x201c;miraculous!&#x201d;</p><p>The plates are recommended as a transformational tool for Mind, Body and Spirit. If you have heard of Tesla&#x2019;s purple energy plates previously and wanted to learn more about them, or if you are discovering them &#x201c;by accident&#x201d; for the first time (nothing is a &#x201c;coincidence&#x201d; in the universe), this volume will be extremely insightful.</p><p>The atoms and electrons of these restructured aluminum plates &#x2013; which were developed by an apprentice working alongside Tesla &#x2013; have been altered so that the purple plates are in resonance, or in tune with the basic energy of the Universe. They function as transceivers, creating a field of energy around themselves, that will penetrate any material substance by osmosis.</p><p>These plates will help to raise the vibrational rate of any individual using them. Many people place their food on the large purple plates, when they are still in paper sacks from the market, to keep their food fresher, longer. Some people sleep on these plates by placing them under their mattress to help give them more stamina and vitality and relieve tensions. No medical claims are made or implied. They are said to have benefited those individuals who have placed them on injured areas of the body. A certain heightened degree of hormonal intimacies among couples has also been reported. This would be similar to the energy generated by Wilhelm Reich&#x2019;s Orgone Accumulator. Though having none of the same properties, and while not working on the same principles, Tesla&#x2019;s plates have become very popular among those working with the devices known as the Black Box or the Rife Machine.</p><p>Indeed, the applications for the plates are many. Just carry the small plates in your pocket or purse or near your bedside or front door for harmony, or in your car while out driving to assist in avoiding stress and fatigue. Better yet, wear the discs as a necklace or earrings. You will find many testimonials in the pages of this book given by those individuals who are convinced that the plates, as inspired by Nikola Tesla, have enhanced their all around well being.</p><p>Indeed a miracle may be on the way once you start working with this discovery which has definitely been given to the world to benefit us all by a man who was a great genius and whom some people insist might actually have had ties to the future &#x2013; did he discover the secrets of time travel? Many have wanted to know in sincere curiosity.</p><p>The author of this volume, Tim R.

Bakara goes on to investigate the magic of crystal healing, chakras, meditation and other magical practices.

This is good news and bad news for Hank-he loves science, but he hates the report part. So Hank turns to TV to take his mind off things. But when the program directory scrolls by too quickly for Hank to know what's on, he decides to take apart the cable box to try to slow down the crawl. Great!

The fantastical, suspend-your-disbelief, rollicking and very funny solution that he and his friends invent, not to mention the desire to decipher the meaning of this book's title, will keep young readers turning the pages. Hank's relationship with his grandfather, his two best friends, his little sister, his parents, and, last but not least, his dog show that despite his problems at school, he has a big, loving heart and a way with people.

A broken heart is genuinely traumatic. Typical recommendations to keep busy, move on, repair your hidden flaws, and then forget about it may not be helpful. In these pages, Susan Piver reveals that heartbreak actually creates an opportunity for genuine emotional and spiritual transformation, enabling you to emerge on the other side stronger, softer, and capable of loving with renewed confidence. <br><br>In the years following her own experience, relationship writer Susan Piver searched the world&#x2019;s wisdom traditions and discovered that heartbreak can be an uncompromising teacher of authenticity, power, and even joy. She shares that wisdom here, with instantaneously recognizable anecdotes, insights, on-the-spot practices, exercises, meditations, and down-to-earth advice that make <i>The Wisdom of a Broken Heart </i>a steadying prescription of solace and encouragement, wisdom and humor during the hardest time of your life. Like an infinitely patient, trusted friend, Piver tells you in a thousand different ways the most important thing to remember and the easiest to forget: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be okay.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Susan Piver</b> is the bestselling author of <i>The Hard Questions: 100 Essential Questions to Ask Before You Say &#x2018;I Do,&#x2019; </i>and the award-winning <i>How Not to Be Afraid of Your Own Life</i>.

She lives in Boston.<b><b>Introduction<br> </b></b> <p>THIS BOOK IS about how to deal with the trauma of a broken heart, the kind you experience when a romantic relationship ends. There is no other experience quite like this one. For many people, the devastating, obsessive nature of a broken heart is a complete surprise. You have a sense of having been physically shattered, right in the middle of your chest. Discomfort takes over your body, making it feel heavy and dull or oddly light, like something that has been burned to a crisp and now floats in the air like ash. Most noticeably, heartbreak puts your own mind outside of your control. You fixate on certain thoughts or events, torment yourself with unanswerable questions such as &#x201c;What if?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How come?&#x201d; and are susceptible to shocking waves of grief that flood you without any warning whatsoever, even while asleep. You can no longer count on yourself to make it through a business meeting or the checkout line at the supermarket without having to stifle tears. </p><p>Everyone and everything you encounter becomes a part of your heartbreak by reminding you of your loss, sadness, and shame. A colleague&#x2019;s casual morning greeting feels like a snooty taunt; missing the bus is testimony to your having been born under a bad sign; and every single couple in every single song, movie, and television show points out either the impossible beauty of love (if they&#x2019;re happy) or the inevitability of it blowing up in your face (if they&#x2019;re not). The whole planet mirrors your sorrow, and there is nowhere to hide. You once thought of daily events as sometimes having to do with you and sometimes not, but now that the wall between your inner life and the outer world has come down, everything becomes extremely personal and intimate. It feels like the world has turned upside down. It has. </p><p>As it turns out, you will see that this is all excellent news. </p><p>I&#x2019;m speaking from firsthand knowledge. Although I&#x2019;ve had my share of relationships and varying degrees of sadness when they ended, I&#x2019;ve had my heart truly broken only once, and it abides in memory as one of the pivotal events of my life. Although I have now happily moved on, I still breathe in the consequences of this incredibly difficult event every day&#x2014;but with gratitude, not despair. </p><p>When this particular relationship ended, I realized that the aches and pains I&#x2019;d experienced in the past had been like a summer rain compared to a tsunami. They were not the same thing at all. When other relationships ended, sure, I had cried, hated him, hated myself, and lost ten pounds&#x2014;the usual. But when this one ended, I didn&#x2019;t just cry, mope, and lose my appetite&#x2014;my entire world also fell apart. I didn&#x2019;t know who I was anymore or what my life meant, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure I&#x2019;d ever recover. </p><p>When it happened, I lived in Austin, Texas, and worked as a bartender in a fabulous nightclub that featured world-class live blues music seven nights a week. All the legends of the genre played there, backed by a stellar house band. I was in my midtwen-ties, had not gone to college, and had zero prospects beyond the bar, but I was incredibly happy for the first time ever. Previously, my life was full of icky things like dreadful depression, major academic failures, and painful relationships. When I left home at age sixteen, I moved about in a cloud of confusion and went from job to job waiting tables, driving a cab, and working as a delivery person. Throughout, I indulged a lifelong interest in spirituality by reading countless books but despaired of ever finding a way to integrate my interests and discoveries into daily life. There seemed to be such an enormous divide between who I was on the inside and how my life looked on the outside. But now, coincidentally (and I&#x2019;m not kidding about the coincidental part&#x2014;I had been traveling crosscountry on a lark and my car broke down in Austin), I found myself living in a town I loved, listening to music I loved, and working with people I came to love. (Shout-out to Antone&#x2019;s: Austin&#x2019;s Home of the Blues.) </p><p>Best of all, I fell madly in love with a guitar player in the house band, and he fell in love with me. I had had boyfriends before, but this was different. I had never known anyone like him. He was gentle and smart and funny and also cool and deep. He made me laugh and taught me so much about music. He was a musician&#x2019;s musician, all soul, no hype, hung out in bars but was superliterary with a special love for Isaac Bashevis Singer. He was a Texan with a taste for Jewish girls, and in Texas, I was like ten Jews put together. <i>Perfect.</i> I adored him. He adored me. </p><p>The first time we kissed, I had an experience that was unforgettable, not just for how powerful it was in that moment, but for how perfectly it christened the nature of our relationship. Held in the circle of his arms, I drew back to look into his eyes and lay my hand on his chest directly over his heart. At that exact moment an inexpressible rush of well-being streamed from his chest into my palm and imparted an otherworldly sense of safety. I had never known such a feeling. We were bound together as lovers in that very moment. With him, finally, I gave myself over to love. Throughout the course of our five-year relationship, every time I placed my palm on his chest, this feeling returned. Even sitting here right now, a gazillion years later, all I have to do is think of him and the feeling returns. This was the kind of love that you can never excise, because you were born with this person already in your heart. </p><p>Over the course of our relationship, several big things happened that made us grateful for the circle of safety created through our embrace. I was almost killed in a truly dreadful car accident, and he took care of me throughout my lengthy hospital stay, sleeping in my hospital room every night and caring for me during the months of recovery. A few years later he was busted for being part of a marijuana-selling operation (of which I had had no knowledge) and ended up going to prison for fourteen months. Out of desperation, he had been trying to make enough money to provide for us, something not likely to happen on a guitar player&#x2019;s income. Death, drugs, lovers&#x2019; sacrifices, and prison: a very bluesy story indeed, with many opportunities to take shelter in each other&#x2019;s arms. </p><p>Even before the prison months, however, we had slipped into an on-again, off-again kind of relationship. Although we were bound together by an undeniable soul-connection and the ability to truly be there for each other in an emergency, everyday life was another story. We could not make a regular life together and would break up and get back together, break up and get back together. During one of these breakups, he started going out with someone else and my heart shattered. Into. One. Million. Pieces. To this day, I can&#x2019;t explain why. </p><p>I was inconsolable. I lost my mind. I was racked with the worst case of jealousy, which I had had no idea I was even capable of; I had not been a jealous person before this event and have never been so again. My sleep was absolutely destroyed&#x2014;every night I had horrible nightmares about him being beyond my reach. My appetite disappeared and I shrank to a skeletal size zero. My friends set up a system to check on me, including a feeding schedule as if I were a baby. (Once, three people came over and wouldn&#x2019;t leave until I drank a fruit smoothie, coaxing me to take sips through a straw.) I filled dozens of journals trying to make sense of this pain. </p><p>Ultimately, after months and months of struggle, I simply could not get over it and moved more than a thousand miles away from the place I loved so dearly, just to get away from this situation. It helped, but only a little. I am not exaggerating when I say that I did not draw breath for two years without also feeling the pain of this breakup. </p><p>Spurred by this utter confusion, my interest in spirituality reached an unprecedented peak. I think I was reading two or three books per week, searching for answers. Why did this hurt so much? How could I make it go away? What was it about me that made this happen? How can you stop loving someone just because they have ceased to love you? All the pain particular to my childhood&#x2014;thinking I was unlovable, overly emotional, and probably stupid&#x2014;resurfaced with a vengeance. The pain of today&#x2019;s broken heart brings back the pain of <i>all</i> broken hearts, beginning from the beginning. My mind rang round the clock with self-recrimination and shame, and I was terrified I would never be able to put my life back together. I was so afraid. I was so sad. </p><p>Then in my readings, I happened to pick up a book that said this: </p><p></p><i><br>This experience of sad and tender heart is what gives birth to fearlessness. Conventionally, being fearless means that you are not afraid or that if someone hits you, you will hit him back ... [But] real fearlessness is the product of tenderness. It comes from letting the world tickle your heart, your raw and beautiful heart. You are willing to open up, without resistance or shyness, and face the world ... If a person does not feel alone and sad, he cannot be a [<i>spiritual</i>] warrior at all...</i> <p>Oh. </p><p>Here was a path that led you, not away from strong emotion but directly toward it; one that applauded the ability to feel deeply&#x2014;not for its dramatic qualities but for its vividness and intelligence. And if the leading qualities of being powerful and courageous&#x2014;of spiritual warriorship&#x2014;were sadness and loneliness, I could imagine quickly advancing through the ranks. For the first time, I read something that made sense. <i>This sadness meant something. It could lead to something good.</i> It was extremely encouraging to think that what I considered most problematic about my situation&#x2014;the overwhelming sorrow and life-wrecking sensitivity&#x2014;might actually be solutions. Heartbreak could be a source of power. </p><p>What I...</p></p><h2>The Tale of Troy (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>The story of Helen and the judgement of Paris, of the gathering Heroes and the seige of Troy; of Achilles and his vulnerable heel, reared by the Centaur on wild honey and the marrow of lions; of Odysseus, the last of the Heroes, his plan for the wooden Horse and his many adventures on his long journey home to Greece.

This is a great way to learn how to cook: mastering basic techniques makes it easy to master new seasonings.&nbsp;<br><br>The dozens of techniques I&#x2019;m going to teach you are ones that you can count on&#x2014;always. They&#x2019;re like master recipes; they offer the foundation and process for getting the juiciest roast chicken, the creamiest risotto. In some cases, only the spices vary. In others, supporting ingredients, such as the vegetables that roast under whole fish or the liquids for soup, are swapped, added, or omitted even as the technique stays the same.&nbsp;<br><br>After more than twenty years as a professional chef and twelve years as the owner and master spice blender of La Bo�te, I&#x2019;m excited to share all I&#x2019;ve learned about cooking with spices. Namely, that a modest investment and minimal effort can result in complex, nuanced dishes. All you have to do to end up with a restaurant-worthy meal in record time is buy a few fresh ingredients and reach into your pantry for spices.<br><br>As far back as I can remember, I&#x2019;ve loved food. While I can&#x2019;t recall my toddler years in Rome, my mother assures me that I relished all the pasta. I do have memories from living in Brussels as a seven-year-old, though, setting little pots and pans on the radiator to &#x201c;cook.&#x201d; I remember going with my grandfather to Antwerp, his hometown. He bought me a watch and a cone of fries with mayonnaise. They were the best fries&#x2014;pure fluffy potato under crisp shells&#x2014;and that they came from my very strict grandfather makes the memory even nicer.&nbsp;<br><br>I was born in northern Israel, and when my parents, sisters, and I returned in 1982 when I was ten years old, we found a horrible culinary environment&#x2014;a pale shadow of what it is today. The many groups that make Israel diverse and delicious&#x2014;Iraqis, Algerians, Moroccans&#x2014;cooked great food, but in their homes, not in restaurants. As in America in the &#x2019;80s, the conversation around good food simply wasn&#x2019;t happening yet. The kibbutz where I lived was a cash-free communal society&#x2014;everyone contributed to the whole, including sharing kitchen duties. Everything was flavorless; food was not a celebration so much as a means of survival.<br><br>Even though we had to run to the bomb shelter every Monday and Wednesday (the alarm would go off and we&#x2019;d get up and go, even if it was midnight), I still had a lot of freedom as a kid. On a kibbutz, the kids run free&#x2014;we lived separately from our parents and only saw them for a few hours a day. I&#x2019;d go fishing with my friends after school, and then cook our catch for dinner the way my father taught me. When sweet potatoes were in season, we&#x2019;d build campfires and bury them in the smoldering logs until the skins ashed over and the flesh caramelized. When we&nbsp;craved ice cream or snacks, we&#x2019;d pick up whatever we wanted from the store and bill our parents&#x2019; accounts&#x2014;it was heaven for a kid!<br><br>When I turned nineteen, I started my compulsory military service with the Israeli army. I did what was asked and, after two years, got a nice promotion to sergeant. One night, during drills, I was dropped off in the middle of the desert and had to find my way back with only the stars and moon for navigation. I remembered the route from the afternoon exercise, but still I thought, <i>What the hell am I doing here?<br><br></i>I was afraid of disappointing my dad, because he had been a paratrooper officer and was proud that I had been chosen for elite training. It was a well-paying job with early retirement and benefits, but it wasn&#x2019;t for me, because I just didn&#x2019;t like the military. I wanted out. I didn&#x2019;t see it as a career. I packed my things, got on a bus, and reported to military court because you can&#x2019;t simply turn down a promotion. It&#x2019;s considered an act of disobedience. After waiting for hours, I was told how severely I should have been treated for my defiance. They could have sent me to jail, but they did something worse&#x2014;I was shipped out to fight in Gaza. And that was that.&nbsp;<br><br>During my three years of service, I felt no fear. People threw Molotov cocktails at us; they dropped refrigerators on us from fourth-floor balconies. It was a strange reality, to say the least.&nbsp;<br><br>You develop a different set of values when life and death are involved. Every holiday feast becomes a big deal, even a bite of the most perfect challah is something to remember, because you start to think that tomorrow, this could all be gone.<br><br>When I left the army, I realized that I wanted to try cooking and that there was more to food than what I had known. But I wasn&#x2019;t sure where to begin, so I did what most Israelis do after military service and took a big overseas trip. Because my older sister had gone to South America after her time in the military, I did too. I spent a year traveling throughout the continent and cooking for fun. When I returned to Israel, I decided to try cooking professionally.<br><br>Israeli chef Gil Frank took a chance on me and gave me a job at Menta, his catering company. Frank said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hire you because no one has ruined your brain yet.&#x201d; He meant that I hadn&#x2019;t learned how to do things the wrong way at another cooking job, so he could teach me the right way. For the next three years, he did. Frank showed me how to hold a knife, dice an onion, master all the basics. He also gave me a lot of freedom and responsibility and helped me see that cooking could be a career. After three years, Frank said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pretty good at this, so it&#x2019;s time&nbsp;for me to let you go.&#x201d; I owe Frank a lot, especially for urging me to move on.<br><br>With Frank&#x2019;s encouragement, I set out for culinary school in France, because there weren&#x2019;t many options in Israel. Plus, a young Israeli chef I met right after he returned from French culinary school told me he loved it. After looking into cooking schools through the Cultural French Institute in Tel Aviv, I spent a week in France visiting the options. I chose the last place I visited, the Paul Bocuse Institute in Lyon, because it offered classes in baking and management as well as the standard savory cooking courses.<br><br>During the two-year program, I learned what I needed to know to succeed as a chef. It wasn&#x2019;t just about cooking, creating, and being inspired&#x2014;the classes included accounting, purchasing, and nutrition. But I was a hardheaded twenty-five-year-old and grew bored in a classroom. I wanted to cook, not do profitand-loss paperwork! I found a six-month externship program in C�ret in the French Pyrenees, and while I thought that the unique Catalan culture and culinary traditions were very interesting, I was even more intrigued with a book given to me by a culinary school instructor. It was written by chef Olivier Roellinger about his three-Michelin-starred restaurant, Les Maisons de Bricourt in Brittany. This was where the world of spices truly opened up for me.&nbsp;<br><br>Even though Roellinger had a strict no-intern policy, he and his wife, Jane, reconsidered after I sent multiple letters requesting an internship. To this day, I don&#x2019;t know what changed their minds; all I know is that they changed my life. They not only took me on as an intern, but paid me, got me an apartment, and introduced me to a new way of understanding spices. Because the world&#x2019;s spice route passed through Brittany&#x2019;s ports, Roellinger incorporated seasonings from around the globe extensively into his cooking, marrying far-flung spices with local seafood and produce. He infamously paired locally caught lobster with a Thai curry sauce&#x2014;standard fare now, but revolutionary then. The spices had come from the other side of the world but didn&#x2019;t take away from the local cuisine. My mind was blown. When I told Roellinger how excited I was by the spices and how he used them, he encouraged me to pursue my interest. He sent me to the local library and we began researching spices together. He never taught me how to use them; rather, he said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you to become me. You have to find yourself.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>After a few more years in France, I moved to New York City in 2002 and joined renowned chef Daniel Boulud at his Michelin-starred flagship restaurant. It was a high-volume&nbsp;and demanding environment, where, as executive chef of the catering arm, I cooked for eight hundred events a year, and not in a restaurant kitchen. We were cooking off-site, at locations that felt more like high-end camping than a Michelin-starred kitchen&#x2014;we used Sternos instead of stoves and washed our hands in coolers because we had no running water. After six years of that, I was ready for a change.</p><h2>A Little Bit of Runes: An Introduction to Norse Divination (Volume 10) (Little Bit Series)</h2><p><b>From one of the world&#x2019;s most renowned authors on spirituality comes an accessible introduction to runes.</b><br> Nordic runes are the most popular and easiest symbols to work with, and can effectively release energy for a positive purpose in one&#x2019;s life.

It&#x2019;s so far north that the United States and United Kingdom both laid claims to the area in the late 1830s in a dispute dubbed the Pork and Beans War, which ended without combat. <br></p><p>The rail-trail takes its name from the Aroostook Valley Railroad. (Local tribes translate Aroostook to &#x201c;beautiful river.&#x201d;) A lumber baron built the railroad in 1910 to haul logs to his Presque Isle sawmill and used the river to generate electricity to power the railroad to Washburn. Over the years, it expanded to Caribou and New Sweden and provided full freight and passenger service, though it hauled more freshly picked potatoes than anything else. Switching to diesel in the 1940s, the line struggled until it ended operations in 1996. <br></p><p>Today the 28.8-mile trail connects with the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Trail (see page 15) in Washburn and is part of the Interconnected Trail System, which comprises thousands of miles of ATV and snowmobile track in the state. Although it passes through four towns with food and lodging, most of the trail is remote, and travelers need to pack for backcountry emergencies. Note that in addition to snowmobiling and snowshoeing, dogsledding is permitted. <br></p><p>Starting at a riverside park on US 1 in Presque Isle, the largest town along the route, the trail follows the south bank of the Aroostook River. (A private ATV and snowmobile route heads east for 23 miles toward the Canadian border along the Canadian Pacific Railroad right-of-way.) You&#x2019;ll head through second-growth forests of spruce, fir, beech, poplar, and birch and, in the clearings, see the vast potato farms for which Aroostook County is known. The trail crosses the river in 5 miles, then rolls along the north riverbank for nearly 5 miles to its junction with the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Trail in Washburn. <br></p><p>Leaving the banks of the Aroostook River and following the trail through town for a mile, you&#x2019;ll take the right fork to remain on the Aroostook Valley Trail heading north. After passing through the Woodland Bog Preserve and arriving in Carson at 3.8 miles, the trail splits: the right branch goes east toward Caribou, and the left continues north to New Sweden. <br></p><p>Caribou is 6.7 miles down the right branch, and, like other towns along the route, many businesses there cater to trail users. You&#x2019;ll find restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, and even bed-and-breakfasts less than 0.5 mile east from the trailhead on Washburn Street. A branch of the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Trail also ends in town. <br></p><p>Heading north from the trail junction in Carson, a separate 7-mile segment to New Sweden also passes through mostly woodland to Westmanland Road. New Sweden got its start after Maine invited immigrants to bolster its economy in the 1870s, and many Swedish events and traditions survive in the area.

Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers&#x2014;precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>. Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now.<br> When her mother&#x2019;s mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice&#x2019;s tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice&#x2019;s mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.<br><br> Read all the books in the<i> New York Times </i>bestselling Splintered series: <i>Splintered (</i>Book 1<i>), Unhinged </i>(Book 2<i>), Ensnared (</i>Book 3<i>), </i>and<i> Untamed (</i>The Companion Novel<i>).</i>&nbsp;<br> Get books 1 through 3 in the Splintered boxed set, available now!<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Splintered:</i></b><br><b>STARRED REVIEW</b><br><br> "Fans of dark fantasy, as well as of Carroll&#x2019;s Alice in all her revisionings (especially Tim Burton&#x2019;s), will find a lot to love in this compelling and imaginative novel."<br> &#x2014;<i>Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</i><br><br><i>"</i>Alyssa is one of the most unique protagonists I've come across in a while.

She lives in Amarillo, Texas.<p></p>Gr 8 Up-This darker, modern update of Alice in Wonderland is more likely to please fans of Tim Burton's film adaptation than those of Lewis Carroll's novel. Alyssa, 16, is a descendant of Alice Liddell, the girl who was Carroll's inspiration for Alice. Her mother lives in a mental institution, and she herself struggles with hearing voices from insects and flowers. Do the women in her family suffer from a curse that can somehow be traced back to the original Alice? The opening chapters drag a bit, but the action picks up when Alyssa finds herself in Wonderland, fighting for her survival-and for her mother's sanity. Howard maintains a lush atmosphere throughout, reintroducing Carroll's characters as truly nightmarish monsters. Though Alyssa's ongoing quests can sometimes seem aimless and the requisite love triangle forced, teens looking for a creepy, descriptive read with a generous dollop of romance will gravitate toward this title.-Hayden Bass, Seattle Public Library, WA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The diverse chapters cover everything from fermented dairy to grains and breads; legumes, nuts, and aromatics; and fermented beverages. Last but not least, the book concludes with more than twenty globally-inspired recipes that incorporate fermented foods into enticing finished dishes like Grilled Lamb Stuffed with Apricot-Date Chutney and Saffron Yogurt Sauce. Offering an accessible, recipe-driven approach, <i>Mastering Fermentation</i> will inspire and equip you to facilitate the transformative, fascinating process of fermentation, with delicious results.</p><p><p>MARY KARLIN is a passionate cook, cooking teacher, cookbook author, and freelance food writer. She was a founding staff member at the award-winning Ramekins Culinary School in Sonoma, CA, where she has taught wood-fired cooking, cheese making, fermentation, and Mediterranean-themed cooking classes for more than ten years. Mary is also a guest instructor at The Fork at Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese in Point Reyes, CA, and The Cheese School of San Francisco, as well as at other prominent culinary venues around the United States. She teaches an online cheese making course entitled &#x201c;Artisan Cheese Making&#x201d; on Craftsy.com. Mary is the author of two previous acclaimed cookbooks:<i> Wood-Fired Cooking</i> (2009) and <i>Artisan Cheese Making at Home</i> (2011). When not teaching, Mary splits her time between Northern California and Arizona where she makes cheese, fills her pantry full of fermented food, and cooks at her wood-fired oven. <br> &nbsp;<br> www.marykarlin.com<br> www.artisancheesemakingathome.com<br> www.masteringfermentation.com</p>Introduction<br><br> Sourdough bread, cheese, yogurt, beer, wine, sauerkraut, kimchi, sweet chile sauce, soy sauce, pickles, and even chocolate are just a few of the fermented foods that are part of our everyday diets. In the United States, we love a wide variety of savory and sweet ferments that many of us probably don&#x2019;t even realize are fermented.<br><br> Have you ever noticed that many cuisines serve fermented foods with their meals? In Asian cuisine, it&#x2019;s a small dish of pickled vegetables or spicy kimchi; in Indian cuisine, a fabulous chutney or lentil dosa; in the Mediterranean, an aromatic herbal beverage after the meal. Yes, these fermented foods and beverages are delectable players in the overall dance of flavors, textures, and tastes of a meal, but just as important as their flavor, ferments play a valuable role in the digestion of the meal and subsequent health of our digestive system. Fermentation makes those foods more digestible and therefore more nutritious. It&#x2019;s a bonus that fermented foods also taste great. <br><br> In many supermarkets today, overprocessed versions have replaced many foods that were traditionally fermented: processed cheese has taken the place of farmhouse Cheddar, pasteurized beers that all taste alike have overtaken regional ales and lagers, preservative-laden bread has replaced homemade loaves made with natural starters. The abundance of these foods throughout our food system makes us believe that these processed versions are safer and healthier for us. But they are not. Many ready-made foods have been robbed of many of their naturally occurring beneficial microorganisms by pasteurization and some extreme high-temperature food-safety processes such as ultra-pasteurization. Not all bacteria are bad for us. The presence of certain bacteria is essential to good health. It is important to our overall health that we get back to the practice of having real fermented foods as key elements of our diets. This is not a fad but a trend back to foods that are good for us, many of which we can make ourselves. Once you&#x2019;ve tasted real fermented foods, you&#x2019;ll want to stick to them, if only because they simply taste better.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why do fermented foods taste so good? Fermentation promotes the growth of desirable bacteria, molds, and yeasts in foods, either food-borne or through the introduction of various &#x201c;starters&#x201d; to create an enzymatic action that transforms the food into an elevated state of flavor and nutritive value. Acidified milk turns into creamy cheese, hard barley kernels mellow into refreshing beer, simple cabbage turns into sauerkraut. <br><br> While on this unpredictable fermentation path, you&#x2019;ll discover numerous unexpected gifts that the foods give you. You may start out to ferment one specific food, and in the process of doing so, be given the bonus of one or more beneficial by-products, what I call &#x201c;many from one.&#x201d; As an example, you may start out to make a fruit vinegar or shrub and find that you have a delicious pulp by-product to turn into a marinade or use to flavor yogurt. That vinegar can become a tasty salad dressing or even flavor a carbonated beverage. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mastering Fermentation, I present a contemporary approach to fermenting popular, useful foods any cook would want in their pantry, as well as extensive tips and recipes for using these fermented foods. I&#x2019;ll share with you the many ways you can make delicious world-class ferments at home using safe, contemporary methods of fermentation and how to easily incorporate them into your cooking repertoire. You can&#x2019;t rush fermentation nor can you wield total control over it, but with proper guidance and encouragement, you can achieve a high level of success.<br> In addition to recipes for creating more than seventy fermented favorites are twenty-two globally inspired contemporary recipes featuring those fermented foods in chapter 9. Once you&#x2019;ve got a pantry (or refrigerator) bursting with flavorful ferments, it&#x2019;s time to put them to good use.<br><br> I invite you to join me on this adventure into the intriguing world of fermentation. Together we&#x2019;ll explore some popular categories of cultured dairy and cheese, fermented fruits and vegetables, sourdough breads and sprouted grains, cured meats and fish, legumes and nuts, and of course fermented beverages. Beyond the pages of this book, you&#x2019;ll find a companion website&#x2014;www.masteringfermentation.com&#x2014;full of additional recipes, tips, charts, and Q &amp; A sections designed to keep information current.

She traces the history of the African-based folk magic brought by slaves to New Orleans, and shows how it evolved over time to include influences from Native American spirituality, Catholicism, and Pentecostalism. She shares her research into folklore collections and 19th- and 20th- century formularies along with her own magical arts.</p><p><i>The Voodoo Hoodoo Spellbook</i> includes more than 100 spells for Banishing, Binding, Fertility, Luck, Protection, Money, and more. Alvarado introduces readers to the Pantheon of Voodoo Spirits, the Seven African Powers, and other important Loas, Prayers, Novenas, and Psalms, and much, much more, including:<br>* Oils and Potions: Attraction Love Oil, Dream Potion, Gambler's Luck Oil, Blessing Oil<br>* Hoodoo Powders and Gris Gris: Algier's Fast Luck Powder, Controlling Powder, Money Drawing Powder<br>* Talismans and Candle Magic<br>* Curses and Hexes</p></p><p><br>This book represents &nbsp;a lifetime of learning and living New Orleans Voodoo hoodoo. I have never before written down so much of my personal knowledge and experience for public consumption. I admit, I was hesitant to share much of it; but, ultimately I felt it was important to preserve the cultural knowledge that was passed on to me through multiple channels. Many of the old ways have been lost or forgotten. Many of the old ways have been diluted through the commercialization of Hoodoo. I know that much of what I learned was impacted by this phenomenon as a child born in 1960, thirty years into the commercial Hoodoo heyday. &nbsp;Like so many things, however, the New Orleans tradition adapted to the changes. As an adult, I have come to understand those things that were "created" by marketeers and those that are pure Hoodoo and conjure. In the end, Hoodoo is about what works.<br><br>One of my goals in writing <i>the Voodoo Hoodoo Spellbook</i> was to emphasize the many influences that are found in the New Orleans tradition. Voodoo and Hoodoo as it is expressed in New Orleans does not look the same as it does in other areas of the country in some very significant ways. A major hallmark is the fusion of Voodoo and Hoodoo - or lack of separation of the two. Voodoo is not just a religion and Hoodoo is not just a magickal system in New Orleans. It never was. And, gris gris is not just a mojo bag. &nbsp;For many of us, Voodoo, Hoodoo, and gris gris are each a part of a whole Creole tradition. Just like the merging of my indigenous, Spanish and French ancestors makes me a whole Creole woman, the merging of multiple cultures makes New Orleans Voodoo and Hoodoo a whole Creole tradition.<br><br>Whether or not you agree with what you read in these pages is not important. What I write is my experience and is my understanding. I am but one person. But, I am one person for whom the tradition lives on in my blood and in the blood of my children and my children's children. I am not writing as an outsider looking in. I write as an insider looking out, and there is a big difference in the two perspectives.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> May the blessings of our beloved Voodoo Spirits be with you always!<br> Denise Alvarado<br> June 7, 2011Like the vibrant streets of New Orleans where author Denise Alvarado was raised, the Voodoo Hoodoo Spellbook will enchant you with its abundance of magical incantations, spells and remedies. It brings love, prosperity, luck, fertility, health, protection and revenge from the traditions of New Orleans Voodoo and hoodoo culture directly to your doorstep.</p><h2>4:50 From Paddington: A Miss Marple Mystery (Miss Marple Mysteries, 7)</h2><p><p> For an instant the two trains ran together, side by side. In that frozen moment, Elspeth witnessed a murder. Helplessly, she stared out of her carriage window as a man remorselessly tightened his grip around a woman�s throat. The body crumpled. Then the other train drew away.</p> <p> But who, apart from Miss Marple, would take her story seriously? After all, there were no suspects, no other witnesses . . . and no corpse.</p></p><p><p>Agatha Christie is the most widely published author of all time, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Her books have sold more than a billion copies in English and another billion in a hundred foreign languages. She died in 1976, after a prolific career spanning six decades.</p>Oh, the contentment of settling down with an Agatha Christie--the happy anticipation of mystery and deceit. This 1957 Miss Marple offers the satisfaction of her solution to the murder witnessed by her friend Elspeth McGillicuddy as one train runs momentarily beside another. Before her recent death, Joan Hickson personified Miss Marple in 12 of the Christie books adapted for television by the BBC. The series seen in the States on PBS and A&amp;E-TV is generally regarded as the most faithful adaptation of Christie's Miss Marple books. On the television and in this audiobook, recorded in 1994, Hickson simply IS the mild, elderly, deceptively parochial lady with piercing insight into human wrongdoing. She also manages to inhabit the other characters in this book beautifully, not so much by creating voices, as by variations in diction and speech rhythm. Her voice is old, yet strong, and her pacing is superb. Rarely have Christie's quiet humor and wry characterizations been so clearly voiced.

In this book, readers will explore and understand the Big Ideas that underlie early math content and learn how to make these foundational ideas clear to young children. The Big Ideas are closely aligned with the content of the Common Core State Standards (2010) and reflect the emphasis defined by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics&#x2019; Curriculum Focal Points (NCTM, 2006). These ideas are developmental, building on children&#x2019;s own thinking to support genuine understanding through constructivist approaches. Each chapter concludes with a video, accessible through the companion DVD, that shows teachers and children engaged in thinking about the Big Ideas.

The sky was pale and colorless above him, the grass a vibrant green at his feet as he faced the wide expanse of the rolling Mississippi River. Behind him, a handful of revelers on the ironwork balconies of the French Quarter could be heard drinking their Hurricanes and ignoring the voluntary evacuation order that had sent so many tourists home. The caf� was still serving their hot beignets and chicory coffee. A few persistent people strolled the green lawns of the square outside St. Louis Cathedral.</p><p>Edmund opened the black case he carried in his left hand and pulled out his trumpet. The yellow brass reflected the city back on itself in the flat afternoon light. He put the horn to his lips and defiantly blew &#x201c;When the Saints Go Marching In&#x201d; into the unnaturally still air. He was not leaving New Orleans, no matter what the weathermen said. He was not leaving his home. New Orleans would stand against any storm that came her way. The TV crews loved it, the image of a lone man facing nature, refusing to bend.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Hurricane Ivan turned east, barely brushing the city with rain as it ran its devastating course along the coast of Alabama. It returned to the mouth of the Mississippi and faltered there. New Orleans was spared. Laissez les bons temps rouler. The fabled city that care forgot danced on.</p><p>The next time, they were not so lucky.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>August 29, 2005<br>HURRICANE KATRINA <br>Saffir-Simpson Category 3 at landfall<br>Casualties: 971; Survivors: 30,000</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>September 14, 2014<br>HURRICANE ISAIAH<br>Saffir-Simpson Category 4 at landfall</p><p>Casualties: 532; Survivors: 27,800</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>August 25, 2015<br>HURRICANE LORENZO <br>Saffir-Simpson Category 3 at landfall<br>Casualties: 1,432; Survivors: 22,345</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>June 30, 2016<br>HURRICANE OLGA <br>Saffir-Simpson Category 5 at landfall</p><p>Casualties: 2,022; Survivors: 20,323</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>July 27, 2017<br>HURRICANE LAURA<br>Saffir-Simpson Category 4 at landfall </p><p>Casualties: 1,371; Survivors: 18,952</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>July 29, 2017<br>HURRICANE PALOMA<br>Saffir-Simpson Category 5 at landfall</p><p>Casualties: estimated 3,500; <br>Survivors: estimated 15,452</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>October 20, 2019<br>HURRICANE JESUS <br>Category 6 at landfall, <br>based on new Saffir-Simpson Scale</p><p>Casualties: estimated 8,000; <br>Survivors: estimated below 10,000</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>AFTER THE STORM DEATHS CAME OTHER CASUALTIES: deaths by debris, cuts, tetanus, or loss of blood; suicide; heart attacks caused by stress of loss, or stress of rebuilding, or just as often from the lack of medicines used to treat common ailments.

I sneeze and wipe my nose on the back of my bare brown arm.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the batch of it, Miss de la Guerre. The two books, the formula, and the bottle, genuine glass.&#x201d; The smuggler McCallan point his boot at the things spread out on my blanket over the broken ground. </p><p>We be near the Market, where the old levee used to be, across from St. Louis Cathedral. What once been a green hill now be a beach dune made of debris&#x2014;everything from washing machines to refrigerators and old cars been hauled and dumped here trying to shore up the levee. But the land gave way when the river rose, and the junk be left behind. Daddy used to say you could give a history of the place just by looking at those layers of trash.</p><p>Beneath us, on the river side of the hill, be a dusty gray beach of pulverized concrete, ground thin by storms. &#x201c;The fabled cement beaches of Orleans,&#x201d; McCallan call them. &#x201c;Finer than the black volcanic sand of Hawaii, or the pink sugar sand of the old Caribbean.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know about that. Nothing left of Hawaii or the Caribbean since the water rose and the storms grew heated. It&#x2019;d take a deep-sea diver just to find them. But Orleans still be here.</p><p>I snort at the blanket and give McCallan a hard look. &#x201c;And the blood, old man? I done give you a good, solid downpay on it. What about that?&#x201d;</p><p>McCallan&#x2019;s eyes crinkle like he be laughing at me. He should know better. Grinning like a fool only make me angry. &#x201c;Sorry, sugar, they were out of both positive and negative at the banks. There&#x2019;s a blood supply shortage out there.&#x201d; He wave his gloved hand behind him, toward the wall and the Outer States. &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t risking my neck and smuggling to the Delta when I&#x2019;m about to retire, now am I?&#x201d;</p><p>I fold my arms. &#x201c;We had a deal. I need that blood.&#x201d;</p><p>McCallan shake his head. &#x201c;We could use more with your fire back home,&#x201d; he say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be missing you, Miss de la Guerre, that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll be missing him, too, though I won&#x2019;t say it. McCallan an old guy, almost forty, but he smart. He been smuggling for more than ten years. He know who to bribe, where to breach the Wall, how to get over while the guard be changing, how to avoid the sniffer drones. I ain&#x2019;t the only one he doing trade with, neither. His regulars know his goods be clean and fresh. He don&#x2019;t sell dirty blood or fake medicine. Even after the government closed the Delta, he kept working&#x2014;trading with the tribes. Delta Fever be harder to kill than a swamp fox. It be always changing, the way those little buggers switch back on they own trails. But if it stay confined to a blood type, if folks keep to theyselves by type of blood, then it slow down somehow. And that why folks like McCallan be necessary. Tribes ain&#x2019;t able to mix together long enough for real trade.</p><p>&#x201c;I did my best, Miss Fen,&#x201d; he say and spread his fingers with a shrug.</p><p>I spit in the gravel and hold out my hand. &#x201c;I want a refund.&#x201d;</p><p>McCallan sigh. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you want the stuff I got or no? I&#x2019;ve come a long way and I&#x2019;m not so sure anybody else is keen enough to buy these damn books off me. Baby Naming and The Developing Years. What are you up to, Fen? You&#x2019;re not knocked up now, are you?&#x201d; he ask, eyeing my belly.</p><p>Shoot, skinny as I be, I sure as hell ain&#x2019;t pregnant. Lydia say I&#x2019;d pass for a boy, if not for the braids she do for me, all wrapped in a topknot on my head to keep out of the way. </p><p>&#x201c;Man, will you stop staring and just make good?&#x201d; I say.</p><p>McCallan blush inside his encounter suit, one of the old kind with thick, mucus-looking skin that turn orangey-yellow when the heat rise in his cheeks. I&#x2019;d be like to suffocate in something so thick, hot as I already be in my cutoff shorts and tank top. My hiking boots be bugging me they so sweaty, but he be wearing that whole suit like a murky second skin.</p><p>&#x201c;Here, doll, take the books and the formula, the bottle.&#x201d; He bend down to the blanket and roll it up for me. &#x201c;And here&#x2019;s your goods back.&#x201d; He hand me back the little bag of gold I gave as down payment. Took a week to scrounge it all up from the teeth of the dead inside the Dome, while I been pretending to pray with the Ursulines.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even melt it down yet, in case you weren&#x2019;t pleased. Use it in the Market. Or better yet, find the O-Negs. They&#x2019;ll charge high, but there&#x2019;s blood to be bought and sold right here.&#x201d;</p><p>I shove the books into my pack and string the sack of gold around my neck to drop down my shirt. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; I remind him. </p><p>My tribe be O-Positive, or OP. And our chieftain, Lydia, don&#x2019;t take kindly to the blood trade. O types don&#x2019;t be needing transfusions like ABs do. The Fever be in us, but it ain&#x2019;t eating O blood up from the inside like it do other types. So O types got to be extra careful of hunters and the farms where they be taking they kidnapped victims to drain them alive. O blood be the universal donor. If we give a drop, they be taking all of it. Lydia say that ain&#x2019;t right. Only ones worse off than us be O-Negs.</p><p>O-Negs don&#x2019;t got the Rh, or Rhesus factor, that O-Positives do. Daddy use to say O positive be like coffee and O neg be like water. You can add water to coffee and it still be coffee, but you add coffee to water and it ain&#x2019;t water no more. Everybody drink water, so O-Negs be used by everyone. Like the rhyme the nuns taught us about the Rules of Blood:</p><p>Types AB, B, and A</p><p>Need to stay away</p><p>From O and from each other,</p><p>Plus from minus, sister from brother.</p><p>O positive can feed</p><p>All positives in need,</p><p>But O neg is the one</p><p>For all tribes beneath the sun.</p><p>I feel McCallan&#x2019;s eyes on my arms as I pack up. He be looking at the shiny scars there along the insides of my arms, wrists to elbows and then some. Burn marks so thick, ain&#x2019;t nobody ever gonna get a needle in the easy way. Not everybody got scars like me. But then again, not everybody willing to die. Somebody want to take my blood, they got to go through the veins in my neck or thigh. They can only bleed me once and I be dead. But that better than being a blood slave.</p><p>McCallan shrug. &#x201c;Best I could do,&#x201d; he say.</p><p>If I hadn&#x2019;t burnt myself up like that, I could give my own blood to Lydia. If she bleed too much while birthing and need it, I&#x2019;d do it without being asked. But I can&#x2019;t or I be dead and she get no help from me after that.</p><p>So I nod. &#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d; Some choices, once you make them, they stay made. And I had my reasons.</p><p>&#x201c;You know, there used to be music here all the time,&#x201d; McCallan say. He looking out across the city like he see someone he used to know and like. &#x201c;Jazz and blues, zydeco. The kind of songs that made your heart sing.&#x201d;</p><p>It be my turn to shrug. &#x201c;Not anymore,&#x201d; I tell him. Music be a surefire way to bring the hunters down on you, or any other kind of trouble you don&#x2019;t want.</p><p>With a final nod, I hitch up my shorts, raggedy edges tickling at the tops of my thighs, and walk away. My old army pack be slung across my shoulders, and my work boots scatter little rocks as I pick my way down the trash heap, past the ruins of Caf� Du Monde, toward the bright blue tarps of the marketplace.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>The Market be bubbling with people today. It hot for October, and folks be all about, trading and swapping this for that. There be food vendors selling fruits and vegetables, fish, and sometimes wild pig, or stewing it up in big pots over wood fires. I can smell the cooking and hear the clamor, but most of it be hidden by the roof tarps, bright blue in the afternoon sun. The Market be right at the edge of the Mississippi, with her back up against the Old French Quarter. The streets behind us belong to the A-Positives now, but the Market been here in one way or another since before Orleans been Orleans, and it be for everyone. </p><p>From the early days before the Wall, they been rotating security, this tribe one day, that tribe the next, keeping it fair and safe. Back when the Fever started, that the only way Os, As, Bs, and ABs could shop without catching they death from Fever. Shop on the day your tribe be guarding&#x2014;if not your own tribe, then another of your type&#x2014;and you be okay. Us O types, we can shop any day. Fever don&#x2019;t run through us quite so bad as it do the rest of them.</p><p>It be an AB day, and I see Harney and his boys messing with them AB girls like they got a chance. Harney be an OP like me, but that where the comparison end. He fifteen and brawny everywhere except the head. Them girls got tattoos, which mean they tribe with La B�te Sauvage. Only thing dumber than making trouble around one of La B�te&#x2019;s girls be making one pregnant. ABs and Os make A or B babies. That just giving La B�te more children for his tribe, and that ain&#x2019;t a good idea for us Os.</p><p>&#x201c;Harney,&#x201d; I call him off. He come over reluctantly, long legs and arms shining with sweat in the sun. He only a year younger than me, but he listen when I call. That be the benefit of my experience. &#x201c;Where Lydia at?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>He shrug and look around like he nervous or something. &#x201c;You know. Where she ever at on Market Day?&#x201d;</p><p>I swear under my breath. Lydia can...</p></p><h2>The Breadwinner Trilogy (Breadwinner Series, 1 - 3)</h2><p>Deborah Ellis&#x2019; trilogy has been a phenomenal success, both critically and commercially. Now young readers can experience this entire epic story in one volume. <i>The Breadwinner</i> is set in Afghanistan, where 11-year-old Parvana lives with her family in a bombed-out apartment building in Kabul. When her father is arrested for the crime of having a foreign education, the family is left with no money or resources. Forbidden to earn money as a girl, Parvana must transform herself into a boy and become the breadwinner. In <i>Parvana's Journey,</i> her father has died and the family has scattered. Parvana, now 13 years old, is determined to find them. Again masquerading as a boy, she joins a group of wandering children, all refugees from war, who exist mainly on courage. In <i>Mud City,</i> the focus shifts to 14-year-old Shauzia, who lives in the Widows' Compound in Pakistan and dreams of escaping to a new life in France. Deborah Ellis uses simple, compelling language, memorable characters, and a wealth of imaginative detail in this wrenching look at the human cost of war that is also a surprisingly hopeful story of survival.</p><p><p>Deborah Ellis has won the Governor General&#x2019;s Award, the Ruth Schwartz Award, the University of California&#x2019;s Middle East Book Award, Sweden&#x2019;s Peter Pan Prize, the Jane Addams Children&#x2019;s Book Award, and the Vicky Metcalf Award for a Body of Work.

Since adolescence, he had read about serial killers and imagined becoming one. Soon after killing the family, he murdered a young woman and then another, until he had ten victims. He named himself &#x201c;B.T.K.&#x201d; (bind, torture, kill) and wrote notes that terrorized the city. He remained on the loose for thirty years. No one who knew him guessed his dark secret. He nearly got away with his crimes, but in 2004, he began to play risky games with the police. He made a mistake. When he was arrested, Rader&#x2019;s family, friends, and coworkers were shocked to discover that B.T.K. had been among them, going to work, raising his children, and acting normal. This case stands out both for the brutal treatment of victims and for the ordinary public face that Rader, a church council president, had shown to the outside world. Through jailhouse visits, telephone calls, and written correspondence, Katherine Ramsland worked with Rader himself to analyze the layers of his psyche. Using his drawings, letters, interviews, and Rader&#x2019;s unique codes, she presents in meticulous detail the childhood roots and development of one man&#x2019;s motivation to stalk, torture, and kill. She reveals aspects of the dark motivations of this most famous of living serial killers that have never before been revealed. In this book Katherine Ramsland presents an intelligent, original, and rare glimpse into the making of a serial killer and the potential darkness that lives next door.</p><p>KATHERINE RAMSLAND is director of the Master of Arts in Criminal Justice Program at DeSales University in Pennsylvania. She writes a regular blog for Psychology Today and has published fifty-nine books including The Mind of a Murderer and Psychopath."Confession of a Serial Killer stands out as the first [book] that takes the form of a collaboration with the serial killer. Unlike many crime books, it does not merely speculate about a predator's deranged thoughts and schemes but rather plunges the reader into them, revealing in remarkable detail how a well-known serial killer at the end of his life sees himself."--Rachel Shteir "The New York Times Magazine"<br><br>"Ramsland says her purpose [in writing the book] was to give criminologists, forensic psychologists and others some first-hand insights into a serial killer's mind, by relating the stories he tells, and how he tells them."--Rachel Shteir "Wichita Eagle"<br><br>For readers interested in the workings of the mind, psychology, true crime, and criminal justice, this is a unique work, in which the author is a conduit to the thinking process, rather than the descriptor of events."--Rachel Shteir "Library Journal"<br><br>"In Confession of a Serial Killer, Dr. Katherine Ramsland got Dennis Rader to reveal the dark fantasies that led him to murder."--Rachel Shteir "Rolling Stone"</p><h2>Nativity</h2><p>In the spirit of her acclaimed <i>Dog Heaven </i>and <i>Cat Heaven</i>, Newbery Medalist Cynthia Rylant illustrates the nativity story in her powerful folk art style.<br><br>Cynthia Rylant takes the beloved text of the nativity story, as told in the King James Bible, and lovingly illustrates it in her simple but bold style that has been called &#x201c;stunning&#x201d; by <i>School Library Journal</i>.

Visit her at CynthiaRylant.com.Newbery Medalist Rylant offers a succinct, graceful account of the birth of Jesus and some of his most famous words as an adult preaching to others. The cover shows three shepherds and one sheep, and the story actually begins on the cover flap with an extension of the cover illustration and just three words, "A child is born." The simple text is adapted from the books of Matthew and Luke from the King James Bible, retaining the traditional flavor and old-fashioned textual cadences. The angels visit the shepherds, and the shepherds visit Mary, Joseph, and Jesus in the stable, but the Wise Men are not included in this interpretation. The story shifts to Jesus as a grown man, preaching the Sermon on the Mount "before a great multitude of people." Four of the Beatitudes are recounted, concluding with a simple house decorated for Christmas and two sheep next to a snow-covered evergreen tree. Rylant's understated illustrations in her refreshing, na�ve style sometimes look like finger paintings and often portray just a suggestion of words from the text. The backgrounds of the double-page spreads are in bold, deep colors, with the figures intentionally small and their faces hidden. This gentle interpretation of the birth of Jesus connected to some of his most important words has its own calm, quiet strength.

Author: Kirkus Reviews Source: September 2017<br><br>In a companion to 2016&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Creation</i>, which drew on the book of Genesis, Rylant crafts a spare, graceful rendition of the Nativity, with text adapted from the King James Bible. Following pages that herald Jesus&#x2019;s birth in Bethlehem, Rylant moves beyond the familiar Christmas story to incorporate several of Jesus&#x2019;s teachings from the Sermon on the Mount, known as the beatitudes: &#x201c;Blessed are the poor, for there is the kingdom of heaven,&#x201d; she writes as a shrouded figure sits beside a battered brick building on a gray night. Humans and animals appear tiny and humble against the vastness of broadly brushed earth and sky in Rylant&#x2019;s naif acylics. The decision to pair the Nativity story with the beatitudes is a wise and profound one, quietly helping Christian readers connect Jesus&#x2019;s birth with the messages of kindness, humility, and compassion he would later preach. Author: Publishers Weekly *STARRED* Source: September 4, 2017<br><br>As she did in the 2016 companion book, Creation, here Rylant distills chapters of the King James Version of the Holy Bible into a gentle and accessible narrative for young readers. It is truly a silent night when the angel of the Lord appears to shepherds as they watch their flock, and the textured but subdued brushstrokes of acrylic paint emphasize the atmosphere&#x2019;s stillness. Even when the multitude fills the night sky, the spare figures of the painted angels in the same white color of the sheep contribute to the soft, ethereal, but majestic tone that remains present in the humble manger where the babe is born. Swiftly but not jarringly, the narrative jumps to Jesus as a grown man, preaching the Sermon on the Mount and closing the book with the beatitudes. Thus, this title is not just about his birth, but also the beginnings of a message that still reaches people today. VERDICT More than appropriate for religious collections, this title adds to Rylant&#x2019;s past works and can be shared beyond Christmas-time.&#x2013;Joanna Fabicon, Los Angeles Public Library Author: School Library Journal Source: October 1, 2017</p><h2>Golf Courses: Fairways of the World</h2><p>Photographer David Cannon began his career in sports photography twenty-five years ago and is considered the premier golf photographer in the world.

Isolated, awkward and a bit rude&#x2014;but a genius. Mary Godwin, age fourteen, is a romantic. Adventurous, astute, and kind, Mary is to become Ada&#x2019;s first true friend. And together, the girls conspire to form the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency&#x2014;a secret constabulary for the apprehension of clever criminals.

Stratford launched the idea for the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency series on Kickstarter, where the response was overwhelming enthusiasm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Stratford lives on Salt Spring Island in British Columbia, Canada, with his wife and children and is hard at work on the next book in the Wollstonecraft Detective Agency series.&#x201c;Force . . . equals . . . mass . . . times . . . acceleration,&#x201d; muttered Ada as she wrote in her notebook. Ada pondered that if you drop a hammer on your foot, it hurts more than dropping, say, a sock on your foot. The acceleration, or speeding up, is the same, but the mass, the solid oomph of a thing, is different. Oomph times zoom equals kaboom!<br><br>Ada and her pondering were cocooned in a square wicker box that resembled a giant picnic basket, just tall enough for her to stand up in and long enough for her to lie down in. Light entered through round, brass-�ringed windows and lit up stacks of books, rolls of paper, the odd screwdriver, and a bundle of pencils. The basket hung from thick ropes beneath a vast patchwork balloon that often swayed savagely in the wind, and the whole contraption was tethered with more ropes to the roof of Ada&#x2019;s Marylebone house in the heart of London.<br><br>The balloon was one of Ada&#x2019;s best inventions. It was filled with hot air from the house&#x2019;s many chimneys, which Ada funneled to it via numerous pipes bolted together. Taken as a whole&#x2014;�pipes, ropes, basket, and balloon&#x2014;�it gave the impression that the stately house was wearing a sort of ridiculous hat.<br><br>Ada lay stretched out on the gondola&#x2019;s floor in her favorite cherry velvet dress, which stopped a full inch above her ankles and showed wear and the odd black grease stain. Her hair was dark brown, almost black, and pulled back into a bun, with little wisps here and there trying to make a run for it.<br><br>What if, Ada wondered in her wicker box, you could accelerate a sock? What if the sock were moving so fast that it could have the same force as a hammer? Would it hurt the same? How fast would the sock have to go, and how could you make a sock go that fast?<br><br>Ada thought like this all the time. And to capture her thoughts, she made drawings&#x2014;�little sketches in notebooks or on scraps of paper or on table linens or, once (at a very dull picnic and much to the displeasure of her recently former governess, Miss Coverlet) on Ada&#x2019;s new dress. The drawing of the moment was a sock cannon of Ada&#x2019;s invention.<br><br>The sock cannon was taking shape on paper and in between Ada&#x2019;s ears. But as busy as her ears were containing the sock-�cannon plans, she could make out the sound of a carriage approaching the Marylebone house.<br><br>Grabbing a brass telescope that had been rolling about on the floor with the swaying of the basket, she stood and flipped open the hatch. She climbed up the three-�step rope ladder to the balloon&#x2019;s short deck, from which she could see as far as Oxford Street. She could see down Wimpole and Welbeck, Wesley and Westmoreland, down Weymouth and Cavendish and Queen Anne and even the little lanes off Baker Street. Only she and the crows knew her neighborhood in this way, from above.<br><br>Her stomach tightened. Walking across busy Marylebone Road, carpetbags in hand, went Miss Coverlet for the last time, leaving Ada alone for good.<br><br>Ada had to admit that &#x201c;alone&#x201d; was not entirely accurate. The house in London was staffed by two women whose names she could never quite remember: Misses Cabbage and Cummerbund, or possibly Arugula and Aubergine&#x2014;she honestly had no idea. When food arrived&#x2014;�with the exception of the bread and butter she&#x2019;d help herself to in the upstairs kitchen&#x2014;�it was at the hands of Miss Coverlet, or Ada&#x2019;s very tall and entirely silent butler, Mr. Franklin. And then the dishes went away, seemingly by themselves, to a place where she supposed something or other must happen to them.<br><br>But as far as Ada was concerned, without Miss Coverlet, whom Ada had known all her life, who had comforted her scrapes and answered her questions and fetched her favorite books and made sure her stockings weren&#x2019;t scratchy&#x2014;�something Ada hated rather desperately&#x2014;�yes, Ada would feel utterly alone.<br><br>At eleven, Ada was deemed too old for a governess, and was now to have a tutor instead. A tutor! Ada knew it was impossible for any living person to educate her. For that, she had her books. Books for learning, books for distraction, books for company, books for making sense of things. Ada&#x2019;s books were full of facts and figures, diagrams and calculations. Books that were not to be argued with. Books that stayed put when you needed them to and didn&#x2019;t run off to get married, as Miss Coverlet was off to do, which seemed to Ada like the stupidest idea ever.<br><br>In most matters, Ada was a genius. Once the facts and figures and charts and calculations from her books wandered into her head, they never left it. Even when she was a baby, Ada had loved number games and puzzles. She fixed things that were broken, and then began fixing things that weren&#x2019;t broken, or broke things so they could be fixed in ways no one else understood or found particularly convenient. But the one puzzle she couldn&#x2019;t solve was people. To Ada, they all seemed to be broken in ways she couldn&#x2019;t make sense of, and couldn&#x2019;t fix.<br><br>Right now there was the puzzle of her heart, which was breaking as Miss Coverlet stepped aboard the carriage.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to my balloon,&#x201d; Ada had said when informed of Miss Coverlet&#x2019;s departure that morning. She supposed that Miss Coverlet might have mentioned getting married before, but Ada hadn&#x2019;t realized that meant she&#x2019;d be leaving and that leaving meant alone. And she certainly hadn&#x2019;t known Miss Coverlet would be leaving today.<br><br>Ada knew that if she was to be alone, then the drawing room, with its grand wallpaper and curlicued gilt frames, its lush Indian carpet and scattering of delicate china, was not where &#x201c;alone&#x201d; was going to happen.<br><br>Miss Coverlet had watched Ada turn and leave, stomping just a little bit for show. Miss Coverlet had seen some very expert stomping from Ada over the years, and this stomping seemed halfhearted.<br><br>Indeed, as Ada now watched Miss Coverlet leave in the carriage, she felt that she had only half a heart left.<br><br>Ada had barely returned to her sock-�cannon plans when she heard the great black lion&#x2019;s-�head knocker strike the front door.<br><br>Whoever it was had best go away. She wanted to be left alone&#x2014;alone as Miss Coverlet had left her, here in her safe wicker fort beneath her balloon, tethered with strong nautical rope to the topmost peak of her house. While she knew she should slide down the rope to the widow&#x2019;s walk and swing into the attic window as she&#x2019;d done a hundred times before, she felt safest here, basket swaying, with her inventions and her books and her drawings. No, she would not come down.<br><br>Not ever.</p><h2>The Catholic Mom&#x2019;s Prayer Companion: A Book of Daily Reflections (CatholicMom.com Book)</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2017 Catholic Press Association Book Award: Collections of Prayers (First Place).</b><br><b>Are you a Catholic mom who prays for the wisdom and patience to get through each day?

Objectivists idealize the former; most of America practices the latter. Though Objectivists are fundamentally against relating to their fellow human beings with various methods of control (bribery, threats, manipulation, slavery), many do not hesitate to relate in that way to the young human beings we temporarily refer to as children. In this short book, Ross examines the contradiction and proposes a theory of Objectivist parenting.</p><p>Roslyn Ross writes, speaks, consults, and produces edutainment on the subject of parenting.

It is autumn and Mouse, accompanied by Minka, a larger rodent wearing a pink jacket, go out to play. As they enjoy the day, Mouse learns about leaves, their colors and shapes, and the fun that comes from piling them up and jumping in them. When Minka hides in the heap, Mouse is confused, but readers will quickly see her tail curling above the fallen foliage. Bright hues evoke the season and realistically show the leaves in all their variety. Swirling brushstrokes and texture add interest to the paintings. Each spread has one or two simple sentences, and additional comments (Pretty! Yippee! Whee!) are spread throughout to add to the fun. This is a pleasant read-aloud for introducing autumn, and it will certainly be enjoyed where the other titles are popular.<i>&#x2013;Susan Lissim, Dwight School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ada threw her raincoat over the radio, but she wasn&#x2019;t sure she was quick enough.<br> <br> <br> <br>&#x201c;George, the fire&#x2019;s out!&#x201d; called Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emergency averted,&#x201d; answered George. The fire alarm stopped beeping, the sprinkler stopped sprinkling. Elliott ran into Ada&#x2019;s room with his new Batman umbrella.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, I missed it again.&#x201d;<br> <br> <br> <br>&#x201c;Ada,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace from the doorway, &#x201c;you may need to fine-tune George.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom may need to fine-tune the toaster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ada . . . ,&#x201d; said Mr. Lace.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, Dad. I&#x2019;ll fix him.&#x201d; Ada had engineered her robot, George, to keep her room safe, but she had already had to replace her rug after their neighbor Jacob grilled his steak in the courtyard and the smoke poured into Ada&#x2019;s room. Clearly, George was doing his job a little too well.<br> <br>&#x201c;Safety first,&#x201d; said George. It was as if he&#x2019;d read her thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s creepy, George,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>The night-light on George&#x2019;s head lit up. &#x201c;This will comfort you,&#x201d; he said. Soothing music drifted out of his speakers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, George, I feel better now. You can go to sleep,&#x201d; said Ada. He rolled into the corner and turned off.<br> <br>Ada pulled the raincoat off her ham radio and dried it off. Then Nina showed up. Ada looked at the clock and realized she was supposed to meet her friend five minutes ago to walk to school.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you were late, so I thought I would just run over here. Whoa! Is that a ham radio?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes! Mr. Peebles gave it to me the other day. I&#x2019;m still trying to figure it out. How did you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just reading about them in my book World of Weird Book 3: Across the Void! Have you contacted a parallel universe yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can even talk to Mr. Peebles now. George may have broken it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;George used it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long story. I can tell you on the way to school.&#x201d;<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>As they walked, Ada told Nina about George&#x2019;s false alarm, and Nina told Ada about her book. In it a group of kids used a ham radio in their clubhouse. First, they talked to people all over the world, then, from . . . other worlds.<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds cool,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;I wish I could do that with my radio.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you can!&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;At this point I&#x2019;d be happy just to talk to someone in Oakland.&#x201d;<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>After school, Ada invited Nina over to help her work on the radio. Nina had all kinds of advice.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, in the book Nate and Fiona wore tinfoil hats.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Really? Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gee, Ada, I thought you knew about this stuff. That way the evil energy from the other world couldn&#x2019;t seep into their brains.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll just start with trying to figure out how to talk to someone in the Bay Area first. Baby steps. Anyway, you need a different kind of radio to speak to other parts of the world. And, uh, probably other worlds, I guess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is it called a ham radio anyway?&#x201d; asked Nina.<br> <br>Ada&#x2019;s dad was passing Ada&#x2019;s room. He couldn&#x2019;t resist a chance to answer. &#x201c;Well, rumor has it that Marconi was a little hungry when he invented radio. So, the first thing he did when he got it working was order a ham sandwich!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad!&#x201d; called Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that true?&#x201d; asked Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not!&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re right. Marconi was Italian. He probably would have ordered capicola or prosciutto.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ugh!&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>Nina didn&#x2019;t seem to know whether to be amused or confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one really knows why it&#x2019;s called a ham,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;Some people think it&#x2019;s an acronym for the three radio innovators: Hertz, Armstrong, and Marconi, but there are other explanations too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada took the cover off the radio and revealed a bunch of brightly colored wires and little nodes fixed to a green circuit board.<br> <br> <br> <br>&#x201c;Gosh! It&#x2019;s so pretty. The cover should be see-through!&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a cool idea. Maybe I&#x2019;ll work on that after I figure out the talking part.&#x201d;<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>There was very little moisture inside from the fire emergency. Still, Ada patted the whole thing down with a towel, just in case. Then she put the casing back on, flicked on the switch, and pressed the button on the microphone.<br> <br>Kilo Delta Eight Papa Kilo Romeo. Anyone out there? Over.<br> <br>KD8PKR looking for someone to talk to. Anyone? Mr. Peebles?<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s KD whatchamacallit? Is it a secret code?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my call sign. I got it with my radio license. I have to use it whenever I talk on ham radio. It&#x2019;s like a . . . special radio name.&#x201d;<br> <br> <br> <br>The radio answered with static. Ada grabbed an antenna she had saved from her dad&#x2019;s old transistor radio. It was longer than the antenna on the ham, so she swapped them. Still, all she heard was static.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand why it&#x2019;s not working.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we add something to it? Like a paper clip?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about a paper clip . . . but I think I saw somewhere that people use aluminum foil.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go get it!&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>Nina ran down to the kitchen and grabbed a roll of aluminum foil. She brought it back upstairs. They ripped a piece off and attached it to the antenna.<br> <br>After a few hours of tinkering, it was time for dinner.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe the signal is still so weak,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;Maybe the buildings are blocking it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we should try a Ouija board,&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I said, I think we have to start with somewhere in our own realm first,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;Anyway, I don&#x2019;t have a Ouija board. I think the antenna needs to be higher up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like on the roof!&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada asked for Mr. Lace&#x2019;s help. Her parents had set some pretty firm rules about Ada climbing things after she&#x2019;d broken her ankle over the summer. Mr. Lace went through the attic window and attached Ada&#x2019;s ham antenna to the roof, just above Ada&#x2019;s window. Even with the extra height, though, Ada and Nina heard mostly static.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br> <br> <br>Ada and Nina tried for the rest of the night to contact someone but they had no luck.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bedtime! Bedtime!&#x201d; said George.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a school night, George,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;I can go to bed a little later tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ada!&#x201d; called Ms. Lace. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for bed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada looked at the clock. It was ten.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; said Ada. &#x201c;You were right, George.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ada was about to turn off the radio, then stopped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we should keep it on. You know, in case it starts working,&#x201d; said Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, you&#x2019;re right. It could be morning for them in the middle of the night,&#x201d; said Nina.<br> <br>&#x201c;For whom?&#x201d; asked Ada.<br> <br>&#x201c;The beings from the other world!&#x201d;</p><h2>Gordon Ramsay Makes It Easy</h2><p>Easy, home-style recipes from chef Gordon Ramsay, star of the hit Fox reality show, &#x201c;Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen.&#x201d;<p>International superstar chef Gordon Ramsay scored a huge hit this past summer with his Fox-TV reality show, &#x201c;Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen,&#x201d; which showcased both his formidable cooking skills and his infamous temper.

She herself has also been wed for 22 years and has seen both the highs and lows of matrimony in her own marriage as well as the marriages of those close to her. While the national divorce rate hovers around the 50% threshold, there is a lot of chatter that marriage as we know it is an outdated institution--that we are too selfish, too unwilling to make sacrifices, and too misguided by elevated expectations of happiness to make marriage work.<br><br>While these points may hold some validity, a lot of this chatter is nothing new. So what's causing so many divorces and, perhaps even more importantly, what are we to do about it if we want marriage to survive? Drawing from both her professional career and personal life, Toler sees that the biggest impediment to marriage these days is that couples decide to take the plunge based almost entirely on the most irrational criteria: falling in love. <br><br><i>Making Marriage Work</i> doesn't suggest that love has nothing to do with marriage at all; rather, Toler says that love by itself is simply not enough to make marriages survive. This book is a logical and simple guide to reintroducing some of the practicality of marriage that has leaked out of it over the years.<br><br>Marriage, Toler says, is a job, and it needs to be treated like one. However, the makeup and consistency of this job has changed so much over the past few decades that the old rules no longer apply. <i>Making Marriage Work</i> is an updated manual to help get the job of marriage done right in this day and age. It suggests specific procedures that should be put in place to bridge the gap between head over heels and happily ever after. It explains how to phrase things in order to span the great hormonal divide men and women often fall into when trying to talk to one another. It also discusses the very new and real challenges to marriage created in a culture often overwhelmed by the emphasis on (and ability to attain) instant gratification. <br><br>Replete with simple, no-nonsense rules, <i>Divorce Court</i> anecdotes, and stories about Judge Toler's own union, <i>Making Marriage Work</i> contains invaluable information couples can use today to secure their marital tomorrow.</p><p>Lynn Toler, a veteran municipal court judge, is the star of the syndicated TV show <i>Divorce Court</i>. Her previous book, <i>My Mother's Rules</i> was published by Agate Bolden in 2007.<br><b>PRAISE FOR LYNN TOLER AND HER PREVIOUS BOOK <i>MY MOTHER'S RULES</i></b>:<br><br> Easy-reading prose and a no-nonsense approach will carry readers through this collection of anecdotes and rules for healthier living...the book's strength lies in the sober, no-nonsense advice." <i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br>"[An] awe-inspiring memoir and self-help guide." <b><i>Ebony</i></b><br><br>"<i>My Mother's Rules</i> reveals the complicated life of 47-year-old Toler...and it shines a light on the humble life of Toni Toler, a Columbus stay-at-home mom whom the judge praises as 'an incredible emotional manager.'" <i><b>Cleveland Plain Dealer</b></i><br><br>"Toler makes <i>Divorce Court</i> work by employing her past experience as an Administrative Judge in Cleveland Heights Municipal Court. She also uses lessons she learned from her mother, who she said was 'tremendous at understanding people's emotions.'" <b><i>Jet</i></b><br><br>"Toler's verdicts [are] homespun wisdom dispensed with a cut-the-bull edge. She [is] as likely to cite her mother's advice as she [is] a precedent-setting decision." <i><b>Cleveland Scene</b></i><br><br>"Toler&#x2019;s humor and wit are some of the characteristics that fans of [<i>Divorce Court</i>] will pick up on quickly - her no-nonsense human sensibilities are another. Something very endearing about the judge is her perceptive nature for the different types of issues and people that come through her studio courtroom." <b>Kenya M.

They&#x2019;ve always done projects together, and they work well as a team. This time, though, they&#x2019;re having trouble coming up with just the right project. Then Julia&#x2019;s mother offers a suggestion: They can raise silkworms, as she did when she was a girl in Korea.<br><br> Patrick thinks it&#x2019;s a great idea. Of course there are obstacles&#x2014;for example, where will they get mulberry leaves, the only thing silkworms eat?&#x2014;but nothing they can&#x2019;t handle.<br><br> Julia isn&#x2019;t so sure. The club where kids do their projects is all about traditional American stuff, and raising silkworms just doesn&#x2019;t fit in. Moreover, the author, Ms. Park, seems determined to make Julia&#x2019;s life as complicated as possible, no matter how hard Julia tries to talk her out of it.<br><br> In this contemporary novel, Linda Sue Park delivers a funny, lively story that illuminates both the process of writing a novel and the meaning of growing up American.</p><p><p><b>Linda Sue Park </b>is the author of bestseller <i>A Long Walk to Water&nbsp;</i>as well as the Newbery Medal book <i>A Single Shard</i>&nbsp;and many other acclaimed novels and picture books.&nbsp;She lives in Rochester, NY. www.lspark.com,Twitter: @LindaSuePark.</p>One<br><br>Patrick and I became friends because of a vegetable.<br>Not just any vegetable. A cabbage.<br>And not just any old cabbage. A Korean pickled cabbage. Which isn&#x2019;t a round cabbage like Peter Rabbit would eat, but a longer, leafier kind. It gets cut up and salted and packed in big jars with lots of garlic, green onions, and hot red pepper, and then it&#x2019;s called kimchee. Kimchee is really spicy. Koreans eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br>I don&#x2019;t like kimchee. My mom says that when I was little, I used to eat it. She&#x2019;d rinse off the spiciness and give me a bite or two. When I got to be six or seven years old, she stopped rinsing it. Most Korean mothers do that, and most Korean kids keep eating it. Not me. I hated the spiciness, and I still do. My mom keeps telling me I should eat it because it&#x2019;s refreshing.<br>But what&#x2019;s so refreshing about having your mouth on fire?<br>My family used to tease me about not liking kimchee. My dad said maybe it meant I wasn&#x2019;t really Korean. We should have your DNA tested,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d tell me. The seven-year-old snotbrain named Kenny who lives with us otherwise known as my little brother would wave big pieces in front of me and threaten to force me to eat them. Another thing about kimchee is, it has a really strong smell. Even though it&#x2019;s stored in jars, you can still smell it, right through the jar and the refrigerator door. It sends out these feelers through the whole house.<br>Three years ago, when I was in fourth grade, we were living in Chicago. I&#x2019;d made friends with a girl named Sarah.<br>The first time she came over to play, she stopped dead in the entryway and said, Eww! What&#x2019;s that smell?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d never really noticed it. Smells are funny that way they can sort of disappear if you live with them all the time. But Sarah was so grossed out that I was really embarrassed.<br>The exact same thing happened again a few weeks later, this time with two friends, a boy named Michael and his sister, Lily. They both stopped dead in their tracks and grabbed their noses.<br>Then they insisted that we play outside because they couldn&#x2019;t stand the smell.<br> I asked my mom to stop making kimchee, but she told me I was being unreasonable. When we moved to Plainfield two years ago, our new apartment didn&#x2019;t smell like kimchee for about half a day. Then my mom unpacked some groceries, including a big jar of kimchee. Sigh.<br>I met Patrick on our second day in Plainfield, a Saturday morning. Actually, I saw him on the first day; he was hanging around on his front steps three doors down, watching the movers. Not just him but his three brothers as well. I noticed him right away, not because of the way he looked brown hair in a normal boy-haircut, a few freckles, a gap between his front teeth that predicted braces in his future but because he seemed to be the closest to my age. The other three boys were little, younger even than Kenny.<br>On the second day, I took a break from unpacking and went out to have a good look at the neighborhood. There they were again, the four boys, like they&#x2019;d never moved off the steps. This time there was a girl with them, too, but she was a lot older.<br>Patrick came down the steps and said hello and told me his name. I said hi back and told him mine.<br> Can I see inside your house?&#x201d; he asked.<br> Sure,&#x201d; I said.<br>As we started down the sidewalk, we were suddenly surrounded by his three younger brothers. Can we come, too?&#x201d; Patrick, we wanna see.&#x201d; Patrick, what&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; Patrick stopped walking. Claire!&#x201d; he yelled. The girl on the steps looked up from picking at her nails. Yeah?&#x201d; she said. Make them stay with you,&#x201d; Patrick said. I can&#x2019;t go barging in with all of them.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m leaving soon. Michelle is picking me up to go to the mall.&#x201d; Well, that means I&#x2019;ll be looking after them then. So you take them for now.&#x201d; Claire stood up. YOU BEEN ICKY!&#x201d; she yelled. At least, that was what it sounded like to me, but later I learned that their names were Hugh, Ben, and Nicholas, and that Hugh was a year older than Ben and Nicky, who were twins, and that they usually got called Hugh-Ben-Nicky&#x201d; all in one breath. Aw &#x201d; Patrick &#x201d; Pleeeeease can we &#x201d; Hugh, let&#x2019;s go see if there are any cookies,&#x201d; Claire said.<br> Hugh let go of Patrick&#x2019;s arm and turned back toward their house. Ben and Nicky trotted after him. Patrick grinned at me. If you get Hugh to do something, you&#x2019;ve got all three of them,&#x201d; he explained.<br> As we walked in the door of my house, Patrick tilted his head and sniffed. I braced myself for his reaction.<br> Whoa,&#x201d; he said. What&#x2019;&#x2019;s that? It smells great!&#x201d; That was the beginning of Patrick&#x2019;s love affair with kimchee. Whenever he eats dinner with us, my mom puts one bowl of kimchee on the table for the family and gives Patrick a whole private bowl for himself. He eats it in huge mouthfuls, someeeeetimes without even adding any rice. I can hardly stand to watch him.<br>Maybe he&#x2019;s the one who needs his DNA tested.<br><br> Goats.&#x201d; No.&#x201d; Sheep.&#x201d; No.&#x201d; Swine.&#x201d; Wine?&#x201d; Patrick and I were sitting on the floor of my room. He was reading aloud from a pamphlet. I was sewing up one of the cushions I keep on my bed. It had split the week before when we had a pillow fight, and the stuffing was falling out.<br>Patrick snorted. Not wine, ssswine. You think they&#x2019;d let us anywhere near alcohol? Anyway, we&#x2019;ve already decided to do an animal project. Wine is not an animal.&#x201d; Patrick and I had just joined the Wiggle Club. Its real name is the Work-Grow- Give-Live! Club (Plainfield Chapter), which means its initials are WGGL, which is why all the kids call it Wiggle.<br>The Wiggle Club is supposed to teach kids about farming. Or at least it started out like that, a long time ago.<br>It used to be for kids who lived on farms, far apart from each other, and it gave them a way to get together. These days, hardly anyone lives on farms; most of the land has been taken over by giant companies. Then the Wiggle clubs got started in cities and suburbs, so now we have one in Plainfield.<br>That&#x2019;s what Mr. Maxwell told us, anyway.<br>He&#x2019;s the guy who runs the Wiggle Club, and he owns one of the only small farms left near Plainfield.<br>In January, club members sign up to do a project. They work on it for months, and the best ones get chosen to be exhibited at the state fair in August. Now it was March, and everyone else in the club had been working on their projects for a couple of months. Patrick and I signed up only a week ago, so we were going to have to work fast.<br>We&#x2019;d just attended our first meeting, where we decided we&#x2019;d do an Animal Husbandry project.<br> Mr. Maxwell?&#x201d; Patrick had waved his hand. Why is it called Animal Husbandry? Are we only allowed to work with male animals?&#x201d; Mr. Maxwell laughed. No, Patrick, we work with both male and female animals. It&#x2019;s called husbandry because it&#x2019;s raising animals, taking care of them &#x201d; Patrick interrupted him. Then why isn&#x2019;t it called Animal Wifery? Wives take care of stuff I mean, like raising babies more than husbands do, don&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; Patrick isn&#x2019;t a rude person, but he really gets into things sometimes, and his ideas sort of pop out of him like he doesn&#x2019;t have any control over them. His question made Mr. Maxwell pause a second. Hmm. I think maybe it&#x2019;s because the word husband&#x2019; has another meaning, one that not many people use anymore. It means to guard or watch over like if someone&#x2019;s resting, we say they&#x2019;re husbanding their strength.&#x2019;&#x201d; Patrick thought it over. He said, Okay, I get it. But wouldn&#x2019;t it be fairer just to call it Animal Parentry?&#x201d; That made Mr. Maxwell laugh again. That would be fairer. Maybe you could start a campaign to change it. In the meantime &#x201d; He handed Patrick a Wiggle pamphlet on Animal Husbandry projects.<br>Patrick began reading it right away. He loves to read. He goes to the library all the time, and if he reads something interesting, he absolutely has to tell me about it. Once, when he was reading late at night about crows, he got so excited about how smart they are they can learn to imitate sounds like car engines or dogs barking, he told me afterward that he forgot how late it was and called me. My dad answered the phone and yelled at him. So now when Patrick&#x2019;s excited like that, he sends me an e-mail instead.<br>Wiggle meetings are held in the community recreation building a few blocks away from where I live. When the meeting ended, we walked to my house. We went up to my room, and that was when Patrick started reading the pamphlet out loud to me.<br><br>Patrick and I went through the whole list of animals. It was discouraging. Most of them were big farm animals, and the rest were ordinary pets dogs, cats, hamsters. We couldn&#x2019;t pick dogs or cats because the townhouses we live in don&#x2019;t allow pets that aren&#x2019;t in cages.<br> We could do a hamster project,&#x201d; Patrick said doubtfully.<br> Bo-o-o-rring,&#x201d; I said. I needed one more piece of thread to finish sewing up the cushion&#x2019;s seam. I licked the end of the thread, held up the needle, and took a deep breath. I always want to thread a needle on my first try it&#x2019;s a thing with me. I poked the thread at the needle&#x2019;s eye.<br>Bingo. Reptiles,&#x201d; Patrick said. Reptiles are more interesting. Maybe we could raise...</p><h2>Grand Blue Dreaming 1</h2><p><b>The hit comedy manga comes to print by popular demand! Swimsuits! Ramen! Dumb jokes! Beer!

This series is unlike any other Presidential commentaries in print, and is characterized by a critical viewpoint that will provide a counterpoint to the more staid analyses that have traditionally accompanied Presidential writings.Thomas Jefferson believed that the pure-principled teachings of Jesus should have been separated from the dogma and abuse of organized religion of the day.

That&#39;s because he&#39;s being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who are terrified Harry will learn that he&#39;s really a wizard, just as his parents were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned to attend an infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed and closer to his own noble destiny.</p><p>The amazing popularity of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i> means that now even Muggles know about the Leaky Cauldron, Diagon Alley, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Whether or not you've read about Harry, this unabridged audiobook brings his world to life. Reader Jim Dale brings an excellent range of voices to the characters, from well-meaning Hermione's soft, earnest voice to Malfoy's nasal droning; from Professor McGonagall's crisp brogue to Hagrid's broad Somerset accent; and from snarling Mr. Filch to p-p-poor, st-tuttering P-Professor Quirrel. Some of the characterizations are peculiar--why do the centaurs have Welsh accents?--but that's a small price to pay to hear one of the myriad ways to sing the Hogwarts School song. Harry Potter fans of all ages--Muggle or not--will enjoy curling up with a few chocolate frogs, a box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans ("Alas! Ear wax!"), and this marvelous, magical audiobook.

She moves on to the gathering of the representatives at the convention and colorfully describes the various issues and arguments that had to be resolved before the Constitution could be written. The vocabulary is rich, and the author incorporates fascinating details about the personalities who undertook this monumental task. The text is placed on clean white space on a quarter of each spread, with a quote from one of the historical figures at the bottom. The remaining three quarters of the spread is given to Harlin's impressive artwork, described as being done in "various water media." The sweep of these realistic paintings across the pages highlights the drama of each situation, and the artist makes remarkable use of perspective, making readers feel as though they are part of the actual scene. A delight for history buffs, perfect for reports, and a good read in general, this well-researched offering should be a first purchase for most libraries.&#x2014;<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She works with numbers: putting them together, taking them apart. Her work is important, but sometimes she wants more. Jeremy Finn is a dreambender. His job is to adjust people's dreams. He and others like him quietly remove thoughts of music and art to keep the people in the City from becoming too focused on themselves and their own feelings rather than on the world. They need to keep the world safe from another Warming. But Jeremy thinks music is beautiful, and when he pops into a dream of Callie singing, he becomes fascinated with her. He begins to wonder if there is more to life than being safe. Defying his community and the role they have established for him, he sets off to find her in the real world. Together, they will challenge their world's expectations. But how far will they go to achieve their own dreams?</p><p>Ronald Kidd is the author of ten novels for young readers, including the highly acclaimed Night on Fire and Monkey Town: The Summer of the Scopes Trial. His novels of adventure, comedy, and mystery have received the Children&#x2019;s Choice Award, an Edgar Award nomination, and honors from the American Library Association, the International Reading Association, the Library of Congress, and the New York Public Library. He is a two-time O&#x2019;Neill Playwright who lives in Tennessee.Gr 4-8-Welcome to civilization after the Warming. Floodwaters rose, and legend tells that survivors rode an arklike craft until they landed in the City. City folk work at prescribed jobs and value history and remembrance as ways not to repeat their ancestors' mistakes. Callie, 13, works as a computer. Her interest in painting and music is discouraged, considered to be a dangerous distraction to society. Not too far away lives young, inquisitive Jeremy Finn, a dreambender. He is learning his job-entering the dreams of City folk and stamping out any perceived threats to society, like Callie's singing. Jeremy sees Callie in his dreams and begins to question his work. He leaves the Meadow to find her, uncovering the secret underpinnings of their society. Jeremy and Callie call for change and freedom in the book's final act. Kidd raises the essential issues of government and free will without violence or despair, making for a kinder, gentler dystopian novel, and explores difficult choices without being preachy. Callie and Jeremy are likable characters who risk everything to be themselves. Other than the threat of discovery and some chase scenes, there isn't much peril, which gives the book a dreamy, peaceful feeling that mutes the drama somewhat. Kidd's spare prose winds around dialogue and description, creating images for readers as vivid as Jeremy's dreams. Short sentences will speed reluctant readers through the text.

Its thin fabric hung loosely on my frame, thanks to punishing daily workouts and a scrupulously fat-free diet, but I felt uncomfortably warm. Perched on the windowsill of our fourth-floor apartment, I dangled my legs in the fresh air. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it was late October. Milwaukee was usually chillier by now, already beginning its slouch toward the interminable Wisconsin winter. I felt the sun baking my face and legs, still bronze from dutiful visits to the tanning salon. The bright, hot rays made me squint and squirm. I didn&#x2019;t want to be here.<br><br>I had just come home from the night before and was suffering the start of a monster hangover. My head throbbed and my itchy skin begged for a shower. Tom Petty was wailing from the stereo speakers: I&#x2019;m tired of myself/Tired of this town. In the parking lot below, I spotted empty beer bottles and stray partiers trudging home from after-hours revelry and drunken couplings.<br><br>Behind me, a couple of my still-drunk college roommates were singing and dancing like banshees before the large open windows in our living room. The place stank of stale beer and cigarettes from a party we had thrown the first week of our junior year and from the many rowdy weekends that had followed. Although we were only two months into the fall semester, our brand-new apartment complex already bore vomit stains on its hallway rugs and fist-sized holes in its plaster walls&#x2014;proof of how most of its student tenants spent their weekends.<br><br>I liked this vantage point, looking down from a distant perch. It made me feel removed from the chaos. I always had felt somewhat separate from the campus party scene, even as I indulged in many of its pleasures. I was a scholarship student carrying a near-perfect GPA, on track to land a prestigious summer internship in Washington, DC, and serving as editor-in-chief of the campus magazine. I had a r�sum� packed with honor society memberships and evidence of a properly raised social consciousness.<br><br>As for the Catholic faith that had dominated my life in elementary and high school, well, that had taken a backseat to other priorities. I still considered myself a better-than-average Catholic. Since my freshman year, I had been active in all the right social justice organizations, devoting at least one afternoon or evening each week to busing tables at a nearby homeless shelter or feeding vagrants through a campus meals-on-wheels program. I attended Mass every Sunday. When it came to sex, I abided by the letter of the law I had been taught in my Catholic home&#x2014;no sex outside marriage&#x2014;though not its spirit. My true zeal was reserved for more concrete concerns, like obsessing over my body to make sure I stayed thin and fit. Unlike the other party girls who devoured late-night pizzas and hid their beer guts under loose-fitting flannel, I told myself, I was in control.<br><br>But lately my pride at compartmentalizing my life so completely&#x2014;being a good girl on Sunday morning and a wild one on Saturday night&#x2014;had begun to give way to something new, a dawning realization that I was as immersed in the chaos as anyone. Maybe I was even worse, because I was leading a double life. At least the potbellied partiers down the hall were consistent. They were not spending their lives keeping up appearances and juggling personas, playing the role of perfectionist honor student for one crowd and reckless reveler for another.<br><br>Looking back over my shoulder into our apartment, I saw my roommates sprawled on the couch, now drowsy and listless after a long night of carousing. I realized that living with them, and living like them, no longer made me happy. Nor did my relationship with the brooding rugby player who routinely rounded up his friends to meet me at whatever bar my friends and I were patronizing that night. I could not call our random meetings dates, and I could not call him my boyfriend. There were no names for such romantic entanglements, no rules of engagement, and most of the time my friends and I had no idea what to make of the men in our lives. We were unconstrained by customs of courtship or social norms. We could do whatever we wanted. Yet the awkwardness, confusion, and disappointment that marked our encounters with men made me wonder: Was our unfettered freedom just a trap in disguise?<br><br>This was not what I had envisioned when I set off for college. I had thought I would spend my Saturday nights discussing Aquinas over coffee and dating the kind of men who send roses, open car doors, and pay for dinner. I ran into a few of those men during my college years, but I had become so inured to the anti-dating ethos of campus life by then that I quickly dropped them and rejoined my friends on the party circuit.<br><br>Returning my gaze to the bleak scene beneath my window, I realized how much things had changed&#x2014;how much I<i> </i>had changed&#x2014;since I first arrived at my freshman dorm that muggy August move-in day. I had lost something. I didn&#x2019;t know what it was or how to get it back. I only knew that this aching emptiness in the pit of my stomach had grown unbearable.<br><br>Suddenly aware that I was shivering, I swung my legs back into the living room. I stood up, slammed the window shut, and strode past my roommates, now sleeping soundly despite the earsplitting music.<br><br>It was time to shower, to eat, to put on something warmer.<br><br>It was time for a change.</p><h2>Gracism: The Art of Inclusion (BridgeLeader Books)</h2><p><ul><li>Best Cover Winner, 2007 ECPA Christian Book Awards (Midlevel Publisher)</li></ul> "The parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor." 1 Corinthians 12:23 When people deal with color, class or culture in a negative way, that's racism. But the answer is not to ignore these as if they don't matter. Instead, we can look at color, class and culture in a positive way. That's gracism. Pastor David Anderson responds to prejudice and injustice with the principle of gracism: radical inclusion for the marginalized and excluded. Building on the apostle Paul's exhortations in 1 Corinthians 12 to honor the weaker member, Anderson presents a biblical model for showing special grace to others on the basis of ethnicity, class or other social distinction. He offers seven sayings of the gracist with practical examples for building bridges and including others. A Christian alternative to secular models of affirmative action or colorblindness, gracism is an opportunity to extend God's grace to people of all backgrounds. Now in paper!</p><p><strong>David A. Anderson</strong> is the founder and senior pastor of Bridgeway Community Church, one of the nation's leading multicultural churches, located in Columbia, Maryland. His previous books include <em>Letters Across the Divide</em> and <em>Multicultural Ministry.</em>In this book the author encourages people to be gracious to minorities and help them live a quality life. Anderson skillfully explains this biblical mandate to care for the marginalized. (Book Bargains and Previews, May 2008)<br><br>If you have been exposed to this idea of God desiring ethnic reconciliation and justice but have felt overwhelmed by the task or wondered why it should even be a priority, this book is for you. (Being Redefined Blog, May 25, 2007)<br><br>Anderson has practiced what he preaches, which is to honor diversity and be committed to the dignity of other races and cultures. His concept of gracism--as opposed to racism--involves not accepting special treatment at the expense of another and not just ministering to the "least of these," but standing alongside them. (Outreach, July/August 2007)<br><br>Anderson's framework is innovative, and the discussion questions included after each chapter will usefully guide the conversations that this provocative manifesto is sure to inspire. (Publishers Weekly, April 9, 2007)<br><br>"After reading this book, I am convinced: we need gracism. Division and inequality are consequences of our fallen world. But as the members of the church we must walk against division and injustice. The brilliance of this book is that we are shown how to overcome individual-level racism, clearly and plainly. Dr. Anderson provides us with real tools for real life. Gracism is an act, a state of being. Members of the body, let's be gracists." (Michael Emerson, Founding Director, Center on Race, Religion, and Urban Life, Rice University, and coauthor of Divided by Faith and United by Faith)<br><br>"Dr. David Anderson is one of the finest reconciliation practitioners that I know. In this book, <em>Gracism: The Art of Inclusion,</em> he honestly shares his journey into a profound concept that has the potential to revolutionize how we confront racism to create a society with liberty and justice for all." (Dr. Brenda Salter McNeil, President, Salter McNeil Associates, LLC, Co-author of The Heart of Racial Justice: How Soul Change Leads to Social Change)<br><br>"David Anderson speaks, lives and is called to the truth of multicultural relationships and ministry. This book is not a book just for black people to work with whites or whites to learn how to be sensitive to blacks, but a book about God's practical, real transforming grace for all people to be kingdom people." (Phil Jackson, lead pastor, The House, coauthor, The Hip-Hop Church)<br><br>"David Anderson addresses one of the real solutions to the issue of racism with this difficult practice of grace! David's take from an African American perspective enlightens us to how deep racism runs even in Christian institutions and relationships, but more than that, he also offers us a biblical initiative to lead us to the vision of being a community that reflects the diversity of God." (Dave Gibbons, lead pastor, NewSong Church, and CVO, Xealot Inc.)<br><br>"A tough-minded book and clear-sighted look at what it means for Christians to 'overcome evil with good.' If metaphor is metamorphosis, the metaphor of 'gracism' will change how we do church like it's changed how I do life." (Leonard Sweet, E. Stanley Jones Professor of Evangelism, The Theological School, Drew University, and Visiting Distinguished Professor, George Fox University)<br><br>"With profound concepts and a compelling voice, <em>Gracism</em> creates an accessible tool for navigating culture clashes. Anderson merges a sophisticated understanding of cultural dynamics with real-time, everyday advice. He takes old-time concepts like 'favor' and gives them flesh and blood for a modern world."

His freedom finally secured, the outlaw disappeared and was never heard from again. Never, that is, until 1948 when he came out of hiding after almost 70 years. In the course of proving his identity to a court of law the outlaw revealed that his friend Billy the Kid was not killed by Pat Garrett but was still alive even to that day. After a period of research and persistence the young lawyer was finally led to a destitute old man in Texas who was named not William H. Bonney but William H. Roberts, although Bonney had been an alias that he had used. Roberts agreed to reveal himself as Billy the Kid if the lawyer would help him obtain a pardon so he could die a free man. You see, the Kid was still wanted for murder so to come forward was to risk being sentenced and put to death, but this was a risk that William H. Roberts was willing to take. He told his story only one time, to one man. This is his story, now presented for the first time with new photographic evidence and research that supports his claim that he was the one true Billy the Kid of legend.</p><p><b>AUTHOR'S NOTE</b><br> In 1882 a notorious outlaw finally walked out of a New Mexico jail a free man.&nbsp; He had just completed serving a prison sentence for the murder of a Texas Ranger and decided prison was not for him.&nbsp; His debt to society paid, he walked out of the prison a free man and disappeared, never to be heard from again...or so we were told.<br> &nbsp;<br> The outlaw was Jesse Evans, founder of the notorious "Jesse Evans Gang". &nbsp;This gang, that roamed New Mexico during the 1870s and 1880s, committed innumerable acts of armed robbery, violence and cattle rustling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its members included such prominent western names as Frank Baker, Jim McDaniels and "Curly Bill" Brocius (among others) but no doubt the gang's most notable acquaintance was Jesse's childhood friend; the legendary Billy the Kid.<br> &nbsp;<br> Traditional history tells us that Billy the Kid was killed in 1881 and that Jesse Evans was never heard from again.&nbsp; The truth, however, is that there is more evidence against this position than we are led to believe.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> In 1948 when the brother of Jesse Evans passed away and his estate needed to be settled, Jesse Evans re-appeared and revealed that he had been living in Florida under the alias Joe Hines.&nbsp; Joe Hines was able to prove to the satisfaction of a court of law that he was the one and only Jesse Evans of legend.&nbsp; You see, his brother had left a parcel of land to Jesse and he intended to get what was rightfully his, and he did.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse told the lawyer handling the case that he was one of three surviving participants of the Lincoln County War. One of the other survivors, he claimed, was his childhood friend William H. Bonney, alias "Kid" Antrim, alias "Billy the Kid". &nbsp;This was a startling claim from someone who had himself been considered long dead and it was against the odds that two surviving old men, both who were of meager means, would have the methods or energy to correct the 70 years of established storyline that had developed around the disappearance of Jesse Evans or the exploits of Billy the Kid. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, the lawyer, William Morrison, contacted the Kid who was now himself living under an alias and approaching 91 years old. At first he was reluctant to share his story, especially since he was technically still wanted and condemned to hang for a crime he didn't commit.&nbsp; However, after some consideration he decided it was more important to make an attempt to secure the pardon he was promised more than 70 years earlier than it was to remain a fugitive outlaw hiding in the shadows.&nbsp; In the end, after a lifetime of hiding and running from the law, Billy wanted to die a free man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrison learned that the Kid's true name was not William H. Bonney, nor was it William H. Antrim.&nbsp; He had used many aliases over the years but his Christian name was William H. Roberts and he had the family bible to prove it.&nbsp; The Kid's story was remarkably normal.&nbsp; He discussed the events of the Lincoln County War and some of his infamous shootouts, but he also spoke equally as proudly of his skill as a cowhand and bronc buster.&nbsp; He spoke with deep emotion regarding his friends who had been killed and filled in many details of the times that had escaped the historians of the time and were only found out to be true many years later.<br> &nbsp;<br> He also provided physical evidence of his identity, both on his own body and in the form of artifacts, and was even able to procure five signed affidavits from surviving witnesses who personally knew Billy the Kid that supported his claim.&nbsp; He spoke to these people in person and was recognized by all of them (and more).&nbsp; When they spoke together they were able to speak conversationally about the old days, each reminding the other of specific events when they were together as old friends do.&nbsp; After these meetings they were each individually and collectively certain that this man was Billy the Kid.<br> &nbsp;<br> Morrison prepared his evidence and brought the ninety year old Billy the Kid before the Governor of New Mexico to obtain his pardon. In the end, however, the Governor made a media circus and a mockery of the proceedings and used it as a publicity stunt rather than treating it as a serious legal matter.&nbsp; It was thus that the testimony of two genuine living legends was discarded for the convenience of popular history as they chose to accept it. &nbsp;Discarded perhaps, discredited for a time, but not before their story was told in full.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> William H Roberts, aka Billy the Kid personally collaborated on his autobiography with William V. Morrison and you are now invited to sit down with him and listen as he tells his story once and for all. &nbsp;Mr. Roberts' was a treasure trove of first hand testimony regarding life in the Wild West.&nbsp; Like all credible living witnesses of the period he would have no doubt been widely pursued and quoted if it were not for the fact that he claimed to be Billy the Kid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many men have from time to time come forward to claim that they were famous historical figures. No one, however, has ever been able to do so with the mountain of evidence that Mr. Roberts was able to provide that he was, in fact, the authentic Billy the Kid of legend.&nbsp; In addition to the signed affidavits from living witnesses that had known the Kid, his physical characteristics the two men shared (including gun and knife wounds), and photographic and physical records that William Henry Roberts had in his possession at the time, Mr. Roberts matched exactly the description of Billy the Kid, including height, weight, eye color, and stature.&nbsp; All of these evidences were available at the time to support his claim. However, despite these things no one of his era except Mr. Morrison was willing to investigate them during his lifetime. <br> What follows is the original tale put forth in collaboration with Mr. Roberts himself before his unfortunate death in 1950.&nbsp; His story is remarkable both in detail and simplicity.&nbsp; After all, Billy the Kid was a period of only a few years out of a life of ninety.&nbsp; Life, it seems, moves on.&nbsp; And much of life does not consist of adventure or amazing exploits but rather hard work and too often scrambling to get by.&nbsp; The story of Brushy Bill Roberts, therefore, is a story that in its entirety makes perfect sense.&nbsp; It explains with great credibility how a very human Billy the Kid began and ended life as a real person and not as a comic book character or dime novel hero.<br> My hope as you read this narrative is that you consider all of the evidence for yourself and that you keep in mind what Mr. Roberts said during this first meeting with Mr. Morrison.<br> He said simply "I done wrong like everyone else did in those days.&nbsp; I have lived a good life since I left New Mexico.&nbsp; I have been a useful citizen.&nbsp; I want to die a free man.&nbsp; I do not want to die like Garrett and the rest of them, by the gun. I have been hiding so long and they have been telling so many lies about me that I want to get everything straightened out before I die.&nbsp; I can do it with some help.&nbsp; The good Lord left me here for a purpose and I know why he did.&nbsp; Now will you help me out of this mess?"<br> <br>Here's to you Brushy, and here's to getting this mess all straightened out once and for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;-Daniel A.

Round up all your friends and track the spread of "disease" using body glitter with an experiment inspired by Edward Jenner, the vaccination pioneer who's credited with saving more lives than any other person in history. Rediscover the wheel and axle with the ancient Sumerians, and perform an astounding experiment demonstrating the theory of angular momentum. Build a simple telescope&#x2015;just like Galileo's&#x2015;and find the four moons he discovered orbiting Jupiter (an act that helped land him in prison).

Two years later, fed up with soap-eating rats, severed human heads and the creepy colonel across the road, they returned to England with a bitter taste in their mouths.<br><br>Two decades on, she turns to a map of the Indian Railways and takes a page out of Jules Verne's classic tale, embarking on an adventure around India in 80 trains, covering 40,000 km - the circumference of the Earth. She hopes that 80 train journeys up, down and across India will lift the veil on a country that has become a stranger to her.<br><br>Along the way, Monisha discovers that the Indian Railways - featuring luxury trains, toy trains, Mumbai's infamous commuter trains, and even a hospital on wheels - have more than a few stories to tell, not to mention a colourful cast of characters. And with a self-confessed "militant devout atheist" in tow, her personal journey around a country built on religion isn't quite what she bargained for...</p><p>Monisha Rajesh is a British journalist at <i>The Week UK</i>.

I am stung with jealousy, not just for the epic journey she makes rediscovering her Indian heritage on ordinary trains, luxury trains, Mumbai's packed commuter trains, even a toy train but just for the talismanic power of such a ticket: the idea that you could have one in your hand tomorrow and just go!&#x2015;<b>Condé Nast Traveller</b><br><br>A rollicking account of Modern India at express pace: from the good sprawling temples and scrapping tigers to the bad groping passengers, churning stomachs and officious ticket inspectors. Rajesh's quick-fire writing is unflinchingly frank, with details packed in as tightly as passengers on Mumbai's commuter trains. A lively read.&#x2015;<b>Lonely Planet Magazine</b><br><br>A wonderfully wry and witty debut. Crackles and sparks with life like an exploding box of Diwali fireworks.&#x2015;<b>William Dalrymple</b><br><br>This beautifully written book is a witty and insightful traveller's-eye view of the country from inside its rail network. It is also an account of a life-shaping journey. An assortment of mustachioed maharajas, wicked wedding-crashers, pinstriped Sikhs, indignant inspectors, spotty know-it-alls in Che Guevara T-shirts and crafty rickshaw drivers bursts from the pages... all of this is done with the lightest of touches and a dry wit. There are laugh-out-loud moments at which seasoned and fresh Indian travellers will cringe with recognition: male snoring on the trains; the drastic effects of the Imodium pill; 87 very good reasons why you should never eat Indian bacon. This excellent debut will stand the test of time. Just like India's railways.&#x2015;<b>Sunday Telegraph</b><br><br>I love train trips and I love travelling around India. If you do too, then this book is a wonderful companion.&#x2015;<b>Irvine Welsh, author of Trainspotting</b><br><br>One can only envy Monisha Rajesh as she embarks on this epic journey through the vast tangle and bewildering extension of India's railways. The ticketing bureaucracy is mad, the travelling companions infinitely varied, the pleasure, discomforts and revelations such that she is guaranteed what even the wriest and most sceptical traveller yearns for: some deeper knowledge of oneself.&#x2015;<b>Tim Parks, travel writer and Booker Prize nominee</b><br><br>Remember Wes Anderson's film <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>, about train journeys in India? Here's the book version. You'll be booking a flight by the final page.&#x2015;<b>Company</b><br><br>Amusing and thoughtful by turns, Rajesh has sidestepped the navel-gazing pitfall common to many wannabe travel writers and piped up with an informative, yet fresh and engaging voice that we will surely be hearing more of.

Is it realistic or even desirable to strive for such an existential equilibrium? Condemning our current cultural obsession with cheerfulness and "positive thinking," Mari Ruti calls for a resurrection of character that honors our more eccentric frequencies and argues that sometimes a tormented and anxiety-ridden life can also be rewarding. <br><br>Ruti critiques the search for personal meaning and pragmatic attempts to normalize human beings' unruly and idiosyncratic natures. Exposing the tragic banality of a happy life commonly lived, she instead emphasizes the advantages of a lopsided life rich in passion and fortitude. She also shows what matters is not our ability to evade existential uncertainty but our courage to meet adversity in such a way that we do not become irrevocably broken. <br><br>We are in danger of losing the capacity to cope with complexity, ambiguity, melancholia, disorientation, and disappointment, Ruti warns, leaving us feeling less "real" and less connected and unable to process a full range of emotions. Heeding the call of our character means acknowledging the marginalized, chaotic aspects of our being, and it is precisely these creative qualities that make us inimitable and irreplaceable.</p><p>Mari Ruti is professor of critical theory at the University of Toronto and visiting professor and director of graduate studies in the Program for Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Harvard University. Her Columbia University Press books are <i>Between Levinas and Lacan: Self, Other, Ethics</i> (2015) and <i>The Call of Character: Living a Life Worth Living</i> (2013).The Call of Character engages questions of perennial interest to philosophers, theorists, and all individuals, and Mari Ruti is perhaps uniquely qualified to write it. She has an uncanny ability to translate complex theoretical issues into clear and readable&#x2015;yet not the least bit dumbed-down&#x2015;prose. Her treatment of the timeless question (what makes for a good life?) is both original and insightful. I wholeheartedly recommend this book. (Amy Allen, Dartmouth College)<br><br>This book will contribute powerfully to discussions of the self from a position both inside and outside the critical psychoanalytic discourse. (Gail Newman, Williams College)<br><br>The Call of Character is expansively erudite yet plain-spoken, honest with a dazzling self-consciousness that situates itself historically in our present moment. Ruti's singular voice gives words to those necessary though often disavowed tensions of human life. I have already used insights from this book in my work with patients, to whom I have directly recommended Ruti's works before. She helps us to understand our private impediments that inherently obscure our relation to our own desires. The Call of Character should be read by academics, clinicians, and students, but most importantly by those who want to live with authentic vitality in a world that makes it seem difficult to do so. (Joseph S. Reynoso, Ph.D., book review editor, <i>Psychoanalytic Psychology</i>)<br><br>Ruti's fabulous new book revels in the unanswerable mystery of the call of character&#x2015;that aspect of ourselves that makes each of us unique, passionate, yet also perpetually dissatisfied and longing for more. In Ruti's hands, dissatisfaction at our incompleteness becomes not a reason for despair but a source of fascination and political possibility: a summons to pursue an erotics of being in the most mundane aspects of our everyday lives.

By the time of his death in 1905, Bouguereau was scorned by progressive painters and critics who saw in his works all that was wrong with the official French world of art, but he was also a favorite of collectors, who found in his paintings of bathers, nymphs, and shepherdesses a realm of eternal beauty far from contemporary life. Bouguereau displayed his talent for drawing at a very early age, became educated at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, was a highly successful portraitist, was exhibited at the Salon to an enthusiastic public, and had his work recognized and awarded at various European expositions during his life.

She lives in Atlanta with her family and can be found online at www.laurelsnyder.com.</p>Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;The sound of the bell that signals the boat's arrival fills Jinny with dread. The boat comes yearly, bringing the new youngest child to the island and taking away the oldest, thus preserving the island's status quo. "Nine on an island, orphans all, any more the sky might fall." This particular bell means the departure of Jinny's best friend, Deen, making Jinny the unwilling new Elder and the newest arrival her responsibility. The island has everything the children need: plentiful fish, nuts, berries, and beehives for honey. There are cabins for sleeping, a supply of clothing, and worn books to read. Even the animals are friendly. Everything is idyllic as long as the rules are followed. When Jinny blatantly breaches a cardinal rule, the island's natural order is upset and everything begins to change. The children's once benevolent home ceases to provide for them and protect them. Jinny knows she is to blame and does the only thing she can think of to fix their broken world. The premise is intriguing, the writing is strong, and the tight pacing will keep readers fully engaged. For those looking for satisfying answers, however, no explanation is ever given for the adultless island, where the boats come from, or what force holds the island together. Why were the children sent to the island in the first place? Where do they go when they leave? For the philosophically inclined, the unanswered questions offer much to ponder and discuss. For more literal-minded young readers, the story is apt to feel unfinished. Here's hoping a sequel is in the works.

Steam boilers blew up. Bridges collapsed under the weight of heavy engines. Locomotives crashed head-on because of signal failures. Passenger cars derailed, often with dire results. Lightly built wooden coaches splintered on impact, and the debris often ignited from the coals in the iron stoves used for heating. In the mid-nineteenth century American railroading was burgeoning--a growth too fast for safe operations.

They flourished in Tibet, the Roof of the World, in its golden days. These teachers belong to the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, a cycle of mystical teachings revealed by the great scholar and adept Jigme Lingpa. <br><br> From the first master, Garap Dorje, to the present, each spiritual personality has his or her own distinctive role to play in this great lineage. In retelling their stories in his own words, the author has sought to bring out their inner feelings as well as their external activities: how they faced and healed physical pain, how they dealt with emotional turmoil, how they overcame spiritual or meditative illusions, and most important, what experiences they had when they awakened their own inner Buddha Mind and Buddha qualities. These biographies not only provide great sources of teachings on meditation, but will also kindle a spiritual flame in the hearts of readers.</p><p>Tulku Thondup Rinpoche was born in East Tibet and was recognized to be a tulku at age five. He studied at Tibet&#x2019;s famed Dodrupchen Monastery, settling in India in 1958 and teaching for many years in its universities. He came to the United States in 1980 as a visiting scholar at Harvard University.&nbsp; For the past three decades he has lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he writes, translates, and teaches under the auspices of the Buddhayana Foundation. His numerous books include <i>The Healing Power of Mind</i>, which has now been published in eighteen languages, and <i>Boundless Healing</i>, which has been published in eleven languages.<b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Preface</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Masters of Meditation and Miracles is a collection of biographies of realized teachers whose lives were full of peace, enlightenment, and amazing miracles. They flourished in Tibet, the Roof of the World, in its golden days. These teachers belong to the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.<br> Longchen Nyingthig (the heart-essence of infinite expanse, or the ultimate truth of the universal openness) is a cycle of mystical teachings that represent the innermost meditation of Dzogpa Chenpo, revealed by the great scholar and adept Jigme Lingpa (1730&#x2013;1798). Jigme Lingpa discovered them as a &#x201c;mind ter&#x201d; (or &#x201c;mind treasure&#x201d;), teachings that were discovered from the enlightened nature of the mind. To Jigme Lingpa and then from him to the present, the transmission of Longchen Nyingthig was passed through the lineage of many enlightened masters, the most outstanding being the ones whose lives are presented in this book.<br> In the past, when I read the biographies that I have epitomized here, I saw them as most inspiring and amazing lives. But this time, as I was retelling them in my own words with my own feelings, I myself frequently underwent the experiences of pain, hardship, or excitement as well as peace, joy, light, or openness that the masters were going through. So the lives were no longer just stories to read or objects &#x201c;out there&#x201d; to think about. They were glimpses of the inner light of the masters, which is the &#x201c;true nature&#x201d; of the enlightened lives. In that &#x201c;true nature,&#x201d; all the different phases and expressions of lives are in communion, like rivers flowing into the ocean, a single body of water. If these biographies are read as stories with intellectual and emotional perceptions, the best possible benefit that could come is inspiration. If the lives are read in order to feel and unite with the experiences of the masters, the stories will certainly arouse spiritual realization, love, peace, openness, light, and healing in the reader&#x2019;s heart.<br> It was improper and indeed impossible for me to try to avoid the typical characteristic of Tibetan biographies, namely the inclusion of endless lists of teachers, teachings, and disciples of the masters, even though those lists might be boring for readers who are not Tibetan. But I tried not to let these details diminish the vividness of the narrative. Wherever possible, I attempted to bring out the inner feelings of the spiritual lives, and at the same time the external daily lives, of the masters: how they faced and healed their physical pain, how they dealt with their emotional turmoil, how they overcame their spiritual or meditative illusions, and, more important, what kind of experiences they had when they awakened their own inner Buddha Mind and Buddha qualities.<br> This book has two parts. The first is an introduction providing a short life of the Buddha and a list of major lineages of Buddhism in Tibet. While basing the Buddha&#x2019;s life on traditional scriptures, I have tried to present it in terms of its meaning and his teachings rather than as a historical narrative. For the list of lineages of Buddhism in Tibet, I have given a structural outline of some of the major ones, but few details of them or their teachings.<br> The second part is the main body of the book. It presents the principle of the three Buddha bodies and the biographies of thirty-five masters of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage.<br> The three Buddha bodies are Dharmak&#x101;ya, the ultimate body, which is the total openness, the absolute nature of the Buddha; Sambhogak&#x101;ya, the enjoyment body, which designates all the true Buddha forms that appear without subject-object duality; and Nirm&#x101;&#x1e47;ak&#x101;ya, the manifested body, which is the forms of the Buddha perceived by ordinary beings. The three Buddha bodies are the sources of the ultimate teachings, such as Longchen Nyingthig.<br> The first master of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage in human form is Prahevajra (also known as Garab Dorje). The lives of the early human masters from Prahevajra down to Guru Rinpoche (9th century CE) have a unique quality. They were manifested as a higher power of discipline and attainments, possessing superhuman endowments and power. From Longchen Rabjam on, although the lives of these later masters reflect a path, dedication, and power different from our own, still they had many experiences that are similar to our own hardships, pain, and emotions, and we can imagine ourselves reaching the point when we would possess their capacity for dedication, healing, and realizations. Thus, the lives of the early masters are the most important ones, but for many readers the lives of the later masters might be easier to understand and empathize with.<br> It seems that there are two reasons for having these two types of biographies. Changes in the art of writing account for some of the differences between the accounts of early and later masters. But the main reason is the change of circumstances and gifts of the audience and their level of openness and appreciation.<br> Among the lives of the later masters, too, there are many, such as Do Khyentse, who were born with amazing wisdom and power, while others, such as the First Dodrupchen and Jigme Gyalwe Nyuku, accomplished the highest spiritual attainments through disciplines of austerity and dedication. Many masters often faced harsh obstructions in their spiritual journey, but the power of their understanding, commitment, and inspiration not only kept them on the path, but led them to their goals.<br> The Longchen Nyingthig transmission flowed through many masters of various lineages. In this book I was able to include only the main masters of the Longchen Nyingthig lineage itself and those masters who were directly involved in bringing the Longchen Nyingthig transmission to my teachers and then on to me.<br> Concerning the lives of many masters there is a vast literature, but for some important masters, Dola Jigme Kalzang, Gyalse Zhenphen Thaye, Khenpo Pema Dorje, the Second Dodrupchen, and �npo Tendzin Norbu, I could find very little material. Also, I focused more on those masters about whom there is little material in English rather than on masters whose lives are already available in English.<br> The masters whose lives are chronicled in this book are some of the many rare individuals whom we had in Tibet during its more than ten-century-long history of Buddhism. One should not, however, get the impression that most of the Tibetans were great meditators and accomplished adepts displaying miraculous powers, as the novel Lost Horizon might portray! Such accomplished masters were very rare in Tibet in comparison with the population as a whole. At the same time, there is no reason to doubt that they were people of great spiritual power and realization. Where the circumstances were right and there was total dedication to the advancement of the spiritual quality of the mind rather than to material progress, such spiritual attainments were witnessed not just in Tibetan civilization, but in many cultures throughout the history of the world during the golden times of their spiritual wealth.<br> For me the material in this book was the most inspiring that I have ever worked on. Each master is totally different, yet they are very similar. Each great master has his or her own unique character to manifest, role to play, and place to fill in this golden lineage of Longchen Nyingthig. Most of these great masters have gone, disappeared into the distant past. But their presence in the golden lineage, their words of enlightening teachings, and their power of liberating blessings are still with us.</p><h2>The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Divination: Learn the Secrets of Astrology, Numerology, Tarot, and Palm Reading--and Predict Your Future</h2><p>What would you do if you could see the future?<br><br>Astrology, numerology, tarot, and palmistry have been used for centuries to divine events to come. <i>The Beginner's Guide to Divination</i> will teach you to practice the mystical arts of divination and predict the future yourself.

Gotta move faster. He pushed his opponent&#x2019;s arm with his left hand, hoping to expose the attacker&#x2019;s right side. He stepped in to deliver a right hook to the body and was rewarded with . . . empty space.<br> <br>The figure had spun around him in a whirl of motion, stopping adjacent to his right shoulder. John immediately knew he&#x2019;d lost. This is going to hurt.<br> <br>He felt a warm breath on the side of his neck, followed by, &#x201c;Too slow. You keep exposing yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop talking and&#x2014;&#x201d; he started to say in frustration, but his words were cut off as his attacker stepped fully behind him, back to back, and hooked his left arm, securing it. The attacker dropped to a knee and gained momentum, twisting and yanking John off his feet.<br> <br>He found himself briefly staring at the fluorescent lighting, and then he crashed to the ground, landing on his back. Before he could react, his attacker straddled him and pinned his arms to his sides with two lean, muscular legs.<br> <br>John stared at the face of his attacker as he managed to yank his right arm from under the crushing force. Before he could do anything with his free hand, though, his opponent leaned in and pinned his right arm to the floor above his head.<br> <br>Merciless blue eyes studied him from inches away. There was no quarter to be given. He thrust his hips upward, trying to buck the figure off, but his efforts only elicited a small smirk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not so fast, tough guy,&#x201d; a low voice said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not done with you yet.&#x201d; The face was closer, looming large in his field of view, and he felt himself being scrutinized. Not again&#x2014;this is getting old.<br> <br>Mercifully, an instrumental version of the Marine Corps hymn started playing from John&#x2019;s encrypted iPhone, and he reflexively glanced toward the sound. Realizing his mistake, he turned back . . . as warm lips suddenly closed on his, and he felt a rush of exhilaration course through his body like electricity as Amira Cerone kissed him hard.<br> <br>John felt himself getting lost in the intense physical connection they shared, but just as quickly, Amira pulled away, and said, &#x201c;Playtime&#x2019;s over, babe. Time to work. It&#x2019;s Logan.&#x201d;<br> <br>She rolled off of him and toward the phone, reaching it with such fluid grace that John couldn&#x2019;t help but stare. A moment later, he found himself snatching the phone out of midair, even as he kept his eyes on Amira.<br> <br>She smiled, and said, &#x201c;You might want to take it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re beautiful, you know,&#x201d; John said, even as he pushed the accept button on the screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not too bad yourself,&#x201d; Amira said as John put the phone to his ear.<br> <br>Logan started talking, and John&#x2019;s eyes followed Amira as she walked across the rubber combatives floor she&#x2019;d installed in her large penthouse, open-floor-plan apartment.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in the shower. Join me if you have time,&#x201d; she added without looking back, as she pulled her black tank top off and moved toward the master bedroom.<br> <br>John was captivated by her slender, muscular physique, and thought, There&#x2019;s no hope for me.<br> <br>His attention was brought back to the phone as Logan said, &#x201c;We have a hit on the Recruiter.&#x201d;<br> <br>John&#x2019;s mind effortlessly shifted gears at the mention of the name of one of Task Force Ares&#x2019; most sought-after high-value targets&#x2014;the man who had recruited a contemptible human being named Jonathan Sommers into the world of treason and espionage. In addition to being the president&#x2019;s former national security advisor, Sommers was also one of the most despicable traitors the country had been subjected to, even if the general population wasn&#x2019;t aware of it.<br> <br>Fortunately for the US, Jonathan Sommers had been betrayed by one of his own victims, Colin Davies, who&#x2019;d set in place precautionary measures&#x2014;out of habit, of all things&#x2014;but who had no idea that the national security advisor was in fact an insider threat. As a result, he&#x2019;d outlined the meetings he&#x2019;d had with Sommers and placed the information in the Google Cloud. Those meetings had started the pursuit for the hijacked DARPA project ONERING, ultimately leading to Colin Davies&#x2019; violent death at the hands of a clandestine Russian special ops team. But in the end, Colin Davies had achieved his vengeance from beyond the grave.<br> <br>Once the task force had returned from Sudan with the ONERING, the first order of business had been to kidnap Jonathan Sommers from his Georgetown home. Logan, John, Cole Matthews, and Amira Cerone&#x2014;the core members of Task Force Ares&#x2014;had executed the operation and then faked Sommers&#x2019; death with assistance from DC&#x2019;s chief medical examiner, whose brother coincidentally was a special agent and executive assistant to Jake Benson, the director of the FBI. More importantly, Jake Benson had been uncle to Deputy Director Mike Benson&#x2014;longtime friend and brother-in-arms of Logan West&#x2014;who&#x2019;d been killed by the Chinese.<br> <br>The faked death had been intended to send a message to the shadowy organization that was Jonathan Sommers&#x2019; real employer, hoping to draw them out into the light. While Sommers had languished away in a specially designed cell in the basement of Ares headquarters on Marine Corps Base Quantico&#x2014;in violation of multiple major laws and statutes, although they all had presidential pardons protecting them&#x2014;subject to nearly daily interrogation, the task force had waited . . . and waited.<br> <br>While they gleaned a treasure trove of information and intelligence from the enthusiastic Sommers&#x2014;names, contact information, and operational details for other members of his organization, which, as it turned out, was in fact called the Organization&#x2014;nothing he provided was actionable, and they all knew it, including Sommers. It was tradecraft 101: the Organization had to assume he was either dead or compromised, which also meant everything he knew could be compromised. As a result, all those identities had likely changed within a day or two after Sommers had been removed from the playing field.<br> <br>But something&#x2019;s changed, or Logan wouldn&#x2019;t be calling me.<br> <br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d; John asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Through the contact Sommers told us about at the Venezuelan embassy,&#x201d; Logan said. &#x201c;After Sommers gave us his list, we put all of them on tasking at every law enforcement agency and member of the Intelligence Community we could.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember how busy the FISA court was. The judges and government attorneys finally earned their keep,&#x201d; John said, referring to the notorious Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court responsible for issuing warrants against foreign agents inside all US borders. &#x201c;We assumed all the intelligence he had would be dead ends. I can&#x2019;t believe any member of their organization would keep the same mobile devices or computers.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, one Luis Silva, a member of the SEBIN, did,&#x201d; Logan said, referring to the Bolivian National Intelligence Service. &#x201c;NSA told Jake that Luis received a phone call yesterday morning on one of the mobile numbers, one he hadn&#x2019;t utilized since we discovered it. The call originated from a landline in a Firehouse Subs shop in Fredericksburg. Jake sent two senior FBI agents with the Counterterrorism Division to talk to the owners of the restaurant. It turns out the phone was located near the front of the store next to the register. No one recalls anyone using it, and the store didn&#x2019;t have any surveillance cameras.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So then how exactly did we find out about it?&#x201d; John asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dumb luck. Turns out there&#x2019;s a new bank under construction across the parking lot, and the construction company had installed cameras the day before in order to prevent vandalism. The agents said there was no way anyone walking in or out of the sub shop would&#x2019;ve known about them, the way they were hidden and how far they were located from the shop. They talked to the foreman at the construction site and were able to review the camera&#x2019;s footage.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; John asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; Logan responded. &#x201c;And guess which sonofabitch showed up on candid camera?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Recruiter,&#x201d; John said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bingo. Based on the description we have from Sommers, there&#x2019;s no doubt about it. Once they had the date-time stamp from the video, they provided it to Jake, who then asked NSA to search their databases for the call to Luis&#x2019; cell phone. Once they found it, they listened to the content, which turned out to be a twenty-second encoded message. Fortunately, NSA has some brilliant cryptographers, and someone who used to work in South America in the eighties figured out that it was a Cuban cipher code used during the sixties in the Cold War,&#x201d; Logan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I thought the only good thing to come out of Cuba was cigars,&#x201d; John retorted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny&#x2014;as in you&#x2019;re not,&#x201d; Logan said, and continued. &#x201c;More importantly, the message was a time and location for a meet. And guess where and when it&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Logan, Amira just kicked my ass for the third time this week. I&#x2019;m really not in the mood for guessing games, especially from you,&#x201d; John said drily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, I can&#x2019;t help it if you can&#x2019;t handle your woman,&#x201d; Logan said good-naturedly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to tell her you said that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You better not&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t want to be on her hit list,&#x201d; Logan said, remembering how she&#x2019;d aggressively interrogated&#x2014;with a stiletto&#x2014;a Chinese operative after Logan and Cole Matthews had been temporarily captured in Sudan six months ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine. Just get to the point. Amira and I are supposed to be having lunch with her dad today, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Damnit. That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Logan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, brother, but lunch is going to have to wait. The meet is set for thirteen hundred at the Udvar-Hazy Air and Space Museum near Dulles Airport. The Recruiter specified &#x2018;Discovery,&#x2019; which could only be the space shuttle display.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s less than five hours from now,&#x201d; John said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, and here&#x2019;s the kicker: it&#x2019;s a Tuesday afternoon, and schools are out for the summer. The head of security told us that it would be bustling with activity. So it&#x2019;s straight-up civilian attire and concealed weapons.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Got it. I better let Amira know,&#x201d; John said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And John, after what happened with Mike, don&#x2019;t forget your vest. Put it in your pack and bring it. You can put it on there. We shouldn&#x2019;t need them, but there&#x2019;s no fucking around with these guys, you understand me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely&#x2014;no taking chances. I got it. By the way, where do you want to meet? You know he could already have someone inside casing the place, right?&#x201d; John stated.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s why Cole will be in as soon as the doors open at ten hundred. He&#x2019;s as good as it gets when it comes to countersurveillance, and I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll enjoy showing off that stupid beard of his,&#x201d; Logan added.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be jealous of our Delta Force of one,&#x201d; John said, mentioning Cole Matthews&#x2019; background as a Delta operator only to irritate Logan. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t help it that you&#x2019;re a pretty boy with those dashing looks and dreamy bright-green eyes of yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jackass,&#x201d; Logan said dismissively. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in the security center on the lower floor, down the steps once you get through the initial security checkpoint. Be there by eleven thirty. When you and Amira get to screening, tell the guards who you are, and they&#x2019;ll send you my way. Remember, these guys know who we are, but we don&#x2019;t think they were able to identify Cole or Amira before we took Sommers out of play.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Understood. Now if you don&#x2019;t mind, I&#x2019;m going to go let Amira know our plans have changed, and I&#x2019;m totally blaming you for it. See you soon,&#x201d; John said, and hung up on his closest friend and ally.<br> <br>Moments later, he knocked on the door to the bathroom loudly enough to be overheard above the sound of running water.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; he heard Amira say as he opened the door. &#x201c;I told you to join me, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; she added in mock exasperation.<br> <br>John stared at her through the glass door, the steam from the shower concealing the details of her gorgeous physique yet somehow accentuating her beauty.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a problem, but not in a bad way. We&#x2019;re going to have to cancel on your dad, though,&#x201d; John said, delivering the bad news as quickly as possible.<br> <br>&#x201c;How is that not a bad thing?&#x201d; Amira asked, staring at him intently. &#x201c;You know how he is. He&#x2019;s been expecting us since we had to cancel last week.&#x201d; Her father, a retired DC homicide detective and widower, cherished the infrequent occasions he spent with his daughter. He knew who her real employer was, and he&#x2019;d accepted the fact that her country unfortunately took top billing in these troubled times.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, but it&#x2019;s the Recruiter&#x2014;he popped up, and he&#x2019;s going to be at the Udvar-Hazy Air and Space Museum at thirteen hundred.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the mention of the target, Amira changed&#x2014;a subtle hardening of her taut figure&#x2014;and John could sense the tension increase across her frame. He smiled at her, waiting for a response.<br> <br>Even though he was in his midforties, he epitomized rugged handsomeness, with short brown hair, defined features, and brown eyes that studied her. Suddenly he gave her his best puppy-dog impersonation and said, &#x201c;But I could still join you. It&#x2019;s the least I can get for getting knocked on my ass again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Amira didn&#x2019;t immediately answer.<br> <br>Finally, she said, &#x201c;So you want to be rewarded for losing, is that it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; John said, and raised his hands. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just doing my best millennial impersonation. Don&#x2019;t hold it against me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute,&#x201d; Amira said, and then, &#x201c;just get your ass in here. We don&#x2019;t have much time.&#x201d;<br> <br>God knows I&#x2019;ll take any time I can get, John thought as he took off his shirt and stepped toward the shower.</p><h2>Ban en Banlieue</h2><p>An evocative exploration of body and politics by one of our most exciting innovative writers. Bhanu Kapil's Ban en Banlieue follows a brown (black) girl as she walks home from school in the first moments of a riot. An April night in London, in 1979, is the axis of this startling work of overlapping arcs and varying approaches. By the end of the night, Ban moves into an incarnate and untethered presence, becoming all matter&#x2015; soot, meat, diesel oil and force&#x2015;as she loops the city with the energy of global weather. Derived from performances in India, England and throughout the U.S., Ban en Banlieue is written at the limit of somatic and civic aims.</p><p>BHANU KAPIL is a British-Indian emigrant to the United States. She is the author of five full-length works of poetry/prose: The Vertical Interrogation of Strangers (2001), Incubation: a space for monsters (2006), humanimal [a project for future children] (2009), Schizophrene (2011), and Ban en Banlieue (2015). Since 2007, she has been incubating &#34;Ban&#34; through performances, talks, and collaborations in the U.S., India, and the U.K. She teaches Interdisciplinary Studies at Naropa University in Boulder, CO.Endorsements:<br><br>Time Out New York chooses Ban en Banlieue as one of their most anticipated books of 2015<br><br>Review Quotes<br><br>&#x201c;The project is presented as an abandoned novel that reads as a document of Kapil&#x2019;s expansive and varied process of researching, planning, and writing. &#x201c;A brown girl on the floor of the world&#x201d; is the central image, and the porous relationship between Ban&#x2019;s story and the story of Kapil writing and thinking about Ban is fundamental throughout. Kapil casts and recasts descriptions of Ban alongside documentation of the author&#x2019;s own acts of lying down, undertaken through performances, protests, and somatic exercises. The result is a complex and deeply engaged &#x201c;literature that is not made from literature.&#x201d;&#x2015;Publishers Weekly<br>&#x201c;It is not a novel so much as a birth, a death, a violent &#x201c;discharge.&#x201d; It was born from an accumulation, a messy building up of notes which was&#x2015;according to Kapil&#x2015;assembled by chopping it up on a butcher&#x2019;s block. The body of Ban En Banlieue was assembled through violence, a body assembled by means of its own violent deconstruction. Even unto itself, this might seem like a self-contradiction that cannot be reconciled. Kapil&#x2019;s beautiful, bleeding, half-dying, half-living, anti-novel is well aware of this.&#x201d;&#x2015;Meghan Lamb, Entropy Magazine</p><h2>Loosed upon the World: The Saga Anthology of Climate Fiction</h2><p>Collected by the editor of the award-winning <i>Lightspeed</i> magazine, the first, definitive anthology of climate fiction&#x2014;a cutting-edge genre made popular by Margaret Atwood.<br><br>Is it the end of the world as we know it?

For any other journo who came down to Phoenix looking for a story, he wouldn&#x2019;t even think of doing them a favor.<br> <br>All those big names looking to swoop in like magpies and grab some meaty exclusive and then fly away just as fast, keeping all their page views and hits to themselves . . . he wouldn&#x2019;t do it.<br> <br>Didn&#x2019;t matter if they were Google/NY Times, Cherry Xu, Facebook Social Now, Deborah Williams, Kindle Post, or Xinhua.<br> <br>But Lucy? Well, sure. For Lucy, he&#x2019;d climb into his sweatbox of a car with all his camera gear and drive his skinny brown ass out to North Phoenix and into the hills on a crap tip. He&#x2019;d drive this way and that, burning gas trying to find a service road, and then bump his way through dirt and ruts, scraping the belly of the Ford the whole way, and he still wouldn&#x2019;t complain.<br> <br>Just goes to show you&#x2019;re a sucker for a girl who wears her jeans tight.<br> <br>But it wasn&#x2019;t just that. Lucy was fine, if you liked a girl with white skin and little tits and wide hips, and sometimes Timo would catch himself fantasizing about what it would be like to get with her. But in the end, that wasn&#x2019;t why he did favors for Lucy. He did it because she was scrappy and wet and she was in over her head&#x2014;and too hard-assed and proud to admit it.<br> <br>Girl had grit; Timo could respect that. Even if she came from up north and was so wet that sometimes he laughed out loud at the things she said. The girl didn&#x2019;t know much about dry desert life, but she had grit.<br> <br>So when she muttered over her Dos Equis that all the stories had already been done, Timo, in a moment of beery romantic fervor, had sworn to her that it just wasn&#x2019;t so. He had the eye. He saw things other people didn&#x2019;t. He could name twenty stories she could still do and make a name for herself.<br> <br>But when he&#x2019;d started listing possibilities, Lucy shot them down as fast as he brought them up.<br> <br>Coyotes running Texans across the border into California?<br> <br>Sohu already had a nine-part series running.<br> <br>Californians buying Texas hookers for nothing, like Phoenix was goddamn Tijuana?<br> <br>Google/NY Times and Fox both had big spreads.<br> <br>Water restrictions from the Roosevelt Dam closure and the drying-up of Phoenix&#x2019;s swimming pools?<br> <br>Kindle Post ran that.<br> <br>The narco murders that kept getting dumped in the empty pools that had become so common that people had started calling them &#x201c;swimmers&#x201d;?<br> <br>AP. Fox. Xinhua. LA Times. The Talisha Brannon Show. Plus the reality narco show Hard Bangin&#x2019;.<br> <br>He kept suggesting new angles, new stories, and all Lucy said, over and over was, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been done.&#x201d; And then she&#x2019;d rattle off the news organizations, the journos who&#x2019;d covered the stories, the page hits, the viewerships, and the click-thrus they&#x2019;d drawn.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not looking for some dead hooker for the sex and murder crowd,&#x201d; Lucy said as she drained her beer. &#x201c;I want something that&#x2019;ll go big. I want a scoop, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I want a woman to hand me a ice-cold beer when I walk in the door,&#x201d; Timo grumped. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m going to get it.&#x201d;<br> <br>But still, he understood her point. He knew how to shoot pictures that would make a vulture sob its beady eyes out, but the news environment that Lucy fought to distinguish herself in was like gladiatorial sport&#x2014;some winners, a lot of losers, and a whole shit-ton of blood on the ground.<br> <br>Journo money wasn&#x2019;t steady money. Wasn&#x2019;t good money. Sometimes, you got lucky. Hell, he&#x2019;d got lucky himself when he&#x2019;d gone over Texas way and shot Hurricane Violet in all her glory. He&#x2019;d photographed a whole damn fishing boat flying through the air and landing on a Days Inn, and in that one shot he knew he&#x2019;d hit the big time. Violet razed Galveston and blasted into Houston, and Timo got page views so high that he sometimes imagined that the cat 6 had actually killed him and sent him straight to Heaven.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d kept hitting reload on his PayPal account and watched the cash pouring in. He&#x2019;d had the big clanking cojones to get into the heart of that clusterfuck, and he&#x2019;d come out of it with more than a million hits a photo. Got him all excited.<br> <br>But disaster was easy to cover, and he&#x2019;d learned the hard way that when the big dogs muscled in, little dogs got muscled out. Which left him back in sad-sack Phoenix, scraping for glamour shots of brains on windshields and trussed-up drug bunnies in the bottoms of swimming pools. It made him sympathetic to Lucy&#x2019;s plight, if not her perspective.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s all been done, Timo thought as he maneuvered his Ford around the burned carcass of an abandoned Tesla. So what if it&#x2019;s been motherfucking done?<br> <br>&#x201c;There ain&#x2019;t no virgins, and there ain&#x2019;t no clean stories,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d tried to explain to Lucy. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s just angles on the same-ass stories. Scoops come from being in the right place at the right time, and that&#x2019;s all just dumb luck. Why don&#x2019;t you just come up with a good angle on Phoenix and be happy?&#x201d;<br> <br>But Lucy Monroe wanted a nice clean virgin story that didn&#x2019;t have no grubby fingerprints on it from other journos. Something she could put her name on. Some way to make her mark, make those big news companies notice her. Something to grow her brand and all that. Not just the day-to-day grind of narco kills and starving immigrants from Texas, something special. Something new.<br> <br>So when the tip came in, Timo thought what the hell, maybe this was something she&#x2019;d like. Maybe even a chance to blow up together. Lucy could do the words, he&#x2019;d bring the pics, and they&#x2019;d scoop all the big-name journos who drank martinis at the Hilton 6 and complained about what a refugee shit hole Phoenix had become.<br> <br>The Ford scraped over more ruts. Dust already coated the rear window of Timo&#x2019;s car, a thick beige paste. Parallel to the service road, the waters of the Central Arizona Project flowed, serene and blue and steady. A man-made canal that stretched three hundred miles across the desert to bring water to Phoenix from the Colorado River. A feat of engineering, and cruelly tempting, given the ten-foot chain link and barbed wire fences that escorted it on either side.<br> <br>In this part of Phoenix, the Central Arizona Project formed the city&#x2019;s northern border. On one side of the CAP canal, it was all modest stucco tract houses packed together like sardines stretching south. But on Timo&#x2019;s side, it was desert, rising into tan and rust hill folds, dotted with mesquite and saguaro.<br> <br>A few hardy subdivisions had built outposts north of the CAP&#x2019;s moat-like boundary, but the canal seemed to form a barrier of some psychological significance, because for the most part, Phoenix stayed to the south of the concrete-lined canal, choosing to finally build itself into something denser than lazy sprawl. Phoenix on one side, the desert on the other, and the CAP flowing between them like a thin blue DMZ.<br> <br>Just driving on the desert side of the CAP made Timo thirsty. Dry mouth, plain-ass desert, quartz rocks, and sandstone nubs with a few creosote bushes holding onto the dust and waving in the blast furnace wind. Normally, Timo didn&#x2019;t even bother to look at the desert. It barely changed. But here he was, looking for something new&#x2014;<br> <br>He rounded a curve and slowed, peering through his grimy windshield. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be goddamned. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Up ahead, something was hanging from the CAP&#x2019;s barrier fence. Dogs were jumping up to tug at it, milling and barking.<br> <br>Timo squinted, trying to understand what he was seeing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah. Hell, yes!&#x201d;<br> <br>He hit the brakes. The car came grinding to a halt in a cloud of dust, but Timo was already climbing out and fumbling for his phone, pressing it to his ear, listening to it ring.<br> <br>Come on, come on, come on.<br> <br>Lucy picked up.<br> <br>Timo couldn&#x2019;t help grinning. &#x201c;I got your story, girl. You&#x2019;ll love it. It&#x2019;s new.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * * *<br> <br>The dogs bared their teeth at Timo&#x2019;s approach, but Timo just laughed. He dug into his camera bag for his pistol.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want a piece of me?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You want some of Timo, bitches?&#x201d;<br> <br>Turned out they didn&#x2019;t. As soon he held up the pistol, the dogs scattered. Animals were smarter than people that way. Pull a gun on some drunk California frat boy and you never knew if the sucker was still going to try and throw down. Dogs were way smarter than Californians. Timo could respect that, so he didn&#x2019;t shoot them as they fled the scene.<br> <br>One of the dogs, braver or more arrogant than the rest, paused to yank off a final trophy before loping away; the rest of the pack zeroed in on it, yipping and leaping, trying to steal its prize. Timo watched, wishing he&#x2019;d pulled his camera instead of his gun. The shot was perfect. He sighed and stuffed the pistol into the back of his pants, dug out his camera, and turned to the subject at hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, hello, good-looking,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t you a sight?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man hung upside down from the chain link fence, bloated from the Phoenix heat. A bunch of empty milk jugs dangled off his body, swinging from a harness of shoelace ties. From the look of him, he&#x2019;d been cooking out in the sun for at least a day or so.<br> <br>The meat of one arm was completely desleeved, and the other arm . . . well, Timo had watched the dogs make off with the poor bastard&#x2019;s hand. His face and neck and chest didn&#x2019;t look much better. The dogs had been doing some jumping.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, vato. Gimme the story.&#x201d; Timo stalked back and forth in front of the body, checking the angles, considering the shadows and light. &#x201c;You want to get your hits up, don&#x2019;t you? Show Timo your good side, I make you famous. So help me out, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>He stepped back, thinking wide-frame: the strung-up body, the black nylon flowers woven into the chain link around it. The black, guttered candles and cigarettes and mini liquor bottles scattered by the dogs&#x2019; frenzied feeding. The CAP flowing behind it all. Phoenix beyond that, sprawling all the way to the horizon.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your best side?&#x201d; Timo asked. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be shy. I&#x2019;ll do you right. Make you famous. Just let me get your angle.&#x201d;<br> <br>There.<br> <br>Timo squatted and started shooting. Click-click-click-click&#x2014;the artificial sound of digital photography and the Pavlovian rush of sweaty excitement as Timo got the feel.<br> <br>Dead man.<br> <br>Flowers.<br> <br>Candles.<br> <br>Water.<br> <br>Timo kept snapping. He had it now. The flowers and the empty milk jugs dangling off the dude. Timo was in the flow, bracketing exposures, shooting steady, recognizing the moment when his inner eye told him that he&#x2019;d nailed the story. It was good. Really good.<br> <br>As good as a cat 6 plowing into Houston.<br> <br>Click-click-click. Money-money-money-money.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, buddy. Talk to your friend Timo.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man had a story to tell, and Timo had the eye to see it. Most people missed the story. But Timo always saw. He had the eye.<br> <br>Maybe he&#x2019;d buy a top-shelf tequila to celebrate his page-view money. Some diapers for his sister Amparo&#x2019;s baby. If the photos were good, maybe he&#x2019;d grab a couple syndication licenses, too. Swap the shit-ass battery in the Ford. Get something with a bigger range dropped into it. Let him get around without always wondering if he was going to lose a charge.<br> <br>Some of these could go to Xinhua, for sure. The Chinese news agencies loved seeing America ripping itself to shit. BBC might bite, too. Foreigners loved that story. Only thing that would sell better is if it had a couple guns: America, the Savage Land or some shit. That was money, there. Might be rent for a bigger place. A place where Amparo could bail when her boyfriend got his ass drunk and angry.<br> <br>Timo kept snapping photos, changing angles, framing and exposure. Diving deeper into the dead man&#x2019;s world. Capturing scuffed-up boots and plastic prayer beads. He hummed to himself as he worked, talking to his subject, coaxing the best out of the corpse.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know it, but you&#x2019;re damn lucky I came along,&#x201d; Timo said. &#x201c;If one of those citizen journalist pendejo lice got you first, they wouldn&#x2019;t have treated you right. They&#x2019;d shoot a couple shitty frames and upload them social. Maybe sell a Instagram pic to the blood rags . . . but they ain&#x2019;t quality. Me? When I&#x2019;m done, people won&#x2019;t be able to dream without seeing you.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was true, too. Any asshole could snap a pic of some girl blasted to pieces in an electric Mercedes, but Timo knew how to make you cry when you saw her splattered all over the front pages of the blood rags. Some piece of narco ass, and you&#x2019;d still be bawling your eyes out over her tragic death. He&#x2019;d catch the girl&#x2019;s little fuzzy dice mirror ornament spattered with blood, and your heart would just break.<br> <br>Amparo said Timo had the eye. Little bro could see what other people didn&#x2019;t, even when it was right in front of their faces.<br> <br>Every asshole had a camera these days; the difference was that Timo could see.<br> <br>Timo backed off and got some quick video. He ran the recording back, listening to the audio, satisfying himself that he had the sound of it: the wind rattling the chain link under the high, hot Arizona sky; meadowlark call from somewhere next to the CAP waters; but most of all, the empty dangling jugs, the three of them plunking hollowly against each other&#x2014;a dead man turned into an offering and a wind chime.<br> <br>Timo listened to the deep thunk-thunk-thunk tones.<br> <br>Good sounds.<br> <br>Good empty desert sounds.<br> <br>He crouched and framed the man&#x2019;s gnawed arm and the milk jugs. From this angle, he could just capture the blue line of the CAP canal and the leading edge of Phoenix beyond: cookie-cutter low-stories with lava-rock front yards and broke-down cars on blocks. And somewhere in there, some upstanding example of Arizona Minuteman militia pride had spied this sucker scrambling down the dusty hillside with his water jugs and decided to put a cap in his ass.<br> <br>CAP in his ass, Timo chuckled to himself.<br> <br>The crunch of tires and the grind of an old bio-diesel engine announced Lucy&#x2019;s pickup coming up the dirt road. A trail of dust followed. Rusty beast of flex fuel, older than the girl who drove it and twice as beat-up, but damn, was it a beast. It had been one of the things Timo liked about Lucy soon as he met her. Girl drove a machine that didn&#x2019;t give a damn about anything except driving over shit.<br> <br>The truck came to a halt. The driver&#x2019;s side door squealed aside as Lucy climbed out. Army green tank top and washed-out jeans. White skin, scorched and bronzed by Arizona sun, her reddish brown hair jammed up under an ASU Geology Department ball cap.<br> <br>Every time he saw her, Timo liked what he saw. Phoenix hadn&#x2019;t dried her right, yet, but still, she had some kind of tenacious-ass demon in her. Something about the way her pale blue skeptical eyes burned for a story told you that once she bit in, she wouldn&#x2019;t let go. Crazy-ass pitbull. The girl and the truck were a pair. Unstoppable.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please tell me I didn&#x2019;t drive out here for a swimmer,&#x201d; Lucy said as she approached.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I was on the other side of town when you called, and I had to burn diesel to get here.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was trying to look jad...</p><h2>Christmas with Paula Deen: Recipes and Stories from My Favorite Holiday</h2><p>Filled with Paula's trademark Southern charm, <i>Christmas with Paula Deen </i>is a collection of beloved holiday recipes and cherished stories.<br><br><i>"I've gone through all my books and put together this collection of my most treasured recipes and memories for the holiday season to share with you...You'll find a few new dishes, a sprinkling of new holiday stories, and some family pictures you might not have seen before."</i><br> <br> There's no holiday Paula Deen loves better than Christmas, when she opens her home to family and friends, and traditions old and new make the days merry and bright. Filled with Paula's trademark Southern charm and happy reminiscences of Yuletide seasons past, Christmas with Paula Deen is a collection of beloved holiday recipes and stories interspersed with cherished family photographs. Included are Paula's most requested homemade gifts of food; a collection of cookies sure to become your family's favorites; easy dishes for a Christmas breakfast or brunch that will let you enjoy the food and your guests; impressive fare for Christmas dinner and holiday entertaining and, of course, spectacular cakes, puddings, pies, and other sweet things.<br> <br> <i>"So Merry Christmas, y'all, and best dishes and best wishes from me and my family to yours."</i></p><p>Paula Deen is the bestselling author of thirteen books and an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning Food Network television star. She was born and raised in Albany, Georgia. She later moved to Savannah, where she started The Bag Lady catering company. The business took off and evolved into The Lady &amp; Sons restaurant, which is located in Savannah&#x2019;s historic district and specializes in Southern cooking. She also co-owns Uncle Bubba&#x2019;s Oyster House with her brother. Paula publishes a bimonthly magazine, <i>Cooking with Paula Deen, </i>and is a regular guest on QVC, where she sells her books and food products.Christmas, that time of good cheer and lapsed diets, is the perfect holiday to showcase the cooking of Food Network star Deen (<i>Paula Deen Celebrates!</i>), who specializes in the kind of butter-and cheese-laden fare that epitomizes family-style comfort food. Sweets and snacks account for most of the recipes, since Deen happily admits to never varying from her Christmas dinner menu, which centers on a Standing Rib Roast and features a trio of potato dishes, including some unbelievably decadent Cr�me Fra�che Mashed Potatoes. Cooks will find the cookies and desserts familiar but richer, like eyebrow-raising but delicious Chocolate Cheese Fudge and creamy Chocolate Sandwich Cookies. Snacks and breakfast dishes are crowd pleasers, like gooey Praline French Toast Casserole and Cheese-coated Bacon Wraps. Devoted viewers of Deen's show may miss the sound of her warm drawl narrating the process, but the smattering of glowing family photos and anecdotes about her grown kids and recent marriage, though she's told them before, are decent stand-ins. Several pages of baking hints are included, but most of the recipes are simple and straightforward enough, with readily available ingredients, that even novices should be able to put together a generous Christmas spread. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The parents themselves may be excellent persons with the best of intentions and love for their children but they may not necessarily be the parents they want to be. This could be because they do not understand children or how to motivate them to good behavior. When parents face these perplexing problems, many feel without adequate guidance. The purpose of this book is to teach parents how to find success with their children. It explains the kind of people parents could be, the home life they must provide, the care and devotion required and the close friendship they must build to reach this success. It teaches clear-cut methods of helping them to be obedient and responsible, of developing their character and intellect to its highest potential and of building a feeling of self-worth.</p><p></p><h2>Speaking of Indians</h2><p>Ella Deloria could speak intimately about Indian ways because she belonged to a Yankton Sioux family. A distinguished scholar who studied with Franz Boas at Columbia University, she had the gift of language and the understanding necessary to bridge races. Originally published in 1944, this book is an important source of information about Dakota culture and a classic in its elegant clarity of insight. <p>Beginning with a general discussion of American Indian origins, language families, and culture areas, Deloria then focuses on her own people, the Dakotas, and the intricate kinship system that governed all aspects of their life. She writes, &#x201c;Exacting and unrelenting obedience to kinship demands made the Dakotas a most kind, unselfish people, always acutely aware of those about them and innately courteous.&#x201d;</p><p>Deloria goes on to show the painful transition to reservations and how the holdover of the kinship system worked against Indians trying to follow white notions of progress and success. Her ideas about what both races must do to participate fully in American life are as cogent now as when they were first written.</p></p><p>Ella Deloria, born in 1889 on the Yankton Reservation, spent her childhood on the Standing Rock Reservation. Her writings include <i>Dakota Texts</i>, <i>Dakota Grammar</i> (a collaboration with Boas), and <i>Waterlily</i> (also a Bison Book).

It clarifies some of moral philosophy&#39;s most common confusions and redefines the science&#39;s terminology. 6 chapters explore: the subject matter of ethics, naturalistic ethics, hedonism, metaphysical ethics, ethics in relation to conduct, and the ideal.</p><p>It took us thousands of years of struggling with science and ethics before we thought to combine the two. While scientific ethics has advanced only gradually, the science <i>of</i> ethics burst into existence in 1903 with the publication of G.E. Moore's <i>Principia Ethica</i>, which did for the study of morality what Whitehead and Russell's <i>Principia Mathematica</i> did for mathematics--clarify old confusions and define terms that are still with us today. Practically overnight, ethicists turned into meta-ethicists, studying their own terms to establish theoretical ground on which to stand before trying to build any prescriptive edifices.<p> Moore begins by clearing up some of the most widely spread confusions plaguing moral philosophy, such as the naturalistic fallacy of Bentham, Spencer, and others who insisted on a precise, concrete definition of <i>good</i>. According to Moore, we have to settle for an intuitive assessment of goodness, and his arguments are powerfully compelling. Proceeding to define terms and territory that have lasted a century, he revolutionized philosophy and single-handedly altered the course of ethical studies for generations. While <i>Principia Ethica</i> isn't the easiest book to read (a dictionary of philosophy comes in handy for most of us), it is well worth careful study by anyone interested in the difference between right and wrong. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Recognized as the definitive starting point for twentieth-century ethical theory, the text is reprinted with the previously unpublished preface Moore wrote for a planned, but never completed, second edition. &#34;Free Will&#34; and &#34;The Conception of Intrinsic Value&#34; are also included from his later ethical writings.</p><h2>The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence</h2><p>How are children&#x2015;and their parents&#x2015;affected by the world's most influential corporation? Henry A. Giroux explores the surprisingly diverse ways in which Disney, while hiding behind a cloak of innocence and entertainment, strives to dominate global media and shape the desires, needs, and futures of today's children.</p><p>Henry A. Giroux is the well-known author of many books and articles on society, education, and political culture. He is the Global Television Network Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University. Grace Pollock recently completed her doctoral degree at McMaster University and a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Western Ontario. Her ongoing research interests include cultural and media studies, historical formations of the public sphere, social policy, and community development.Henry A. Giroux and Grace Pollock's revised and expanded edition of <i>The Mouse That Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence</i> presents tools, key concepts and analyses, and the context to provide a critical pedagogy of all things Disney. The author's dissection of the Disney Empire shows that it is not only selling entertainment and related products but a way of life and value system that the authors critically unpack. This is a valuable resource for all parents, teachers, and those interested in cultural studies of contemporary culture. (Douglas Kellner, UCLA; author of Media Culture and Media Spectacle and the Crisis of Democracy)<br><br><i>The Mouse That Roared: Disney And The End of Innocence</i> by Henry A. Giroux and Grace Pollock sets a new standard for the study of Disney and popular culture. It offers new lens to understand the merger between corporate power and corporate culture while unveiling the insidious educational force of pre-packaged culture. This brilliant book should be read by every parent, educator, and youth. (Donaldo Macedo, University of Massachusetts, Boston)<br><br>Disney productions carry important cultural authority but until now we have lacked sure-footed guides to unpack the consequences when Disney products get embedded in everyday play, learning, and growing up. Now Henry Giroux and Grace Pollock in their revised and expanded edition of Giroux's pioneering study give us the tools with which to talk back to Disney's world. These tools are especially welcome because other ways of talking back to consumer culture have been relentlessly closed down by neoliberals. This book offers a crucial intervention in cultural politics for any place where Disney products sell. (Nick Couldry, London School of Economics and Political Science)<br><br>Giroux is an author of many books and articles on education, politics, and corporate influence. This highly critical examination of the Disney corporation explores the scope of influence that Disney has over the developing minds (and bodies) of children as it uses the facade of innocence and nostalgia marketing to promote consumerism over values such as reading and creative play, which are known to stimulate intelligence and social interaction better than the passive viewing of television and movies. Giroux asks us to reevaluate the seemingly innocuous animated Disney productions and theme parks, which focus on a safe, sanitized, middle-class white depiction of the American ideal, while promoting racial and sexual stereotypes in films such as Aladdin and The Little Mermaid. He points out the hypocrisy (or is it irony?) of the feature WALL-E, which depicts Earth as a desolate wasteland despoiled by rampant consumerism and an overreaching mega-corporation, while at the same time promoting WALL-E robots, action figures, playsets, apparel, stationery, and other 'collectibles' in the real world. This updated and expanded edition (with the help of coauthor Pollock) includes a discussion on Disney&#x2019;s focus on marketing toward the lucrative 'tween' segment, as well as two new chapters, 'Globalizing the Disney Empire' and 'Disney, Militarization, and the National Security State after 9/11.' Well researched and well written, despite the academic jargon. (<i>Booklist, Starred Review, May 2010</i>)<br><br>Henry Giroux and Grace Pollock survey this theme with abundant brilliance. (<i>Dissident Voice, May, 2010</i>)</p><h2>Make Your Own Damn Movie!: Secrets of a Renegade Director</h2><p><p>Lloyd Kaufman, the writer/producer/director of such cult-classic films as <i>The Toxic Avenger</i>, <i>Class of Nuke 'Em High</i>, and <i>Tromeo and Juliet</i>, offers a guide to movie-making unlike any other available anywhere. In 25 years, Kaufman, along with partner Michael Herz, has built Troma Studios up from a company struggling to find its voice in a field crowded with competitors to its current--and legendary--status as a lone survivor, a bastion of true cinematic independence, and the world's greatest collection of camp on film.</p><p>As entertaining and funny as it is informative and insightful, <i>Make Your Own Damn Movie! </i>places Kaufman's radically low-budget, independent-studio style of filmaking directly in the reader's hands. Thus we learn how to: develop and write a knock-out screenplay; raise funding; find locations and cast actors; hire a crew; obtain equipment, permits, and music rights (all for little or no money); make incredible special effects for $0.79 each; charm, schmooze, and network while on the film-festival circuit; and, finally, make a bad actor act so bad it's actually good.</p><p>From scriptwriting and directing to financing and marketing, this book is brimming with utterly off-the-wall, decidedly maverick, yet consistently proven advice on how to fully develop one's idea for an independent film.</p></p><p><p><b>Lloyd Kaufman </b>has written, produced, and/or directed more than 25 films, including <i>The Toxic Avenger, Sgt.

I was surrounded on every side by vermin, roaches, and rat shit. And I wasn&#x2019;t even meeting with executives at Blockbuster. This was the basement of the Troma Building in New York City. For years, Troma has occupied this four-story building in the part of Manhattan formerly known as Hell&#x2019;s Kitchen.6 From this mighty temple, we had steered the mighty ship of Troma through such films as <i>Tromeo &amp; Juliet, Terror Firmer</i>, and <i>Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV</i>. The Troma Building occupied a proud, majestic place on the New York skyline. But now, disease and decay had entered the works. Rats threatened the very foundation of the Troma Building. The Troma Building&#x2019;s basement is Troma&#x2019;s memory center, its archive, its remembrance of things past. In other words, it&#x2019;s where a lot of shit has been dumped and forgotten about over the years. And now, it had been invaded by rodents. No one knew quite where the rats had come from. The Troma Building had remained relatively pest-free for the better part of two decades. It seemed like no small coincidence that the arrival of the rats perfectly coincided with the opening of a brand new McDonald&#x2019;s directly next door to the office. Thanks to that devil-worshipping, burger-shilling corporate clown, Troma was lousy with humongous, voracious rodents that knew no fear. And now, everything in our basement was contaminated by rat shit and had either been partially eaten by the rats or was in imminent danger of being so. Now ordinarily, ridding the basement of rats the size of baby coyotes would be a job for anybody but me. After all, I am president and cofounder of the fucking company. You don&#x2019;t see Harvey Weinstein in the flooded basement of Miramax trying to salvage old promotional T-shirts and baseball caps from <i>Playing for Keeps</i>.7 But, after years of doling out the most backbreaking, humiliating, odious tasks imaginable, I had finally stumbled across a job so disgusting and wretched that <i>nobody</i> would accept it. Even our interns (who are, by their very nature, subjected to more humiliation than our regular employees simply by virtue of the fact that they are unpaid) refused to take it on. The choice was simple. Either we seal the basement forever like some old, abandoned mine that&#x2019;s been tapped out or rendered unsafe and just write off thirty years of Troma history (an option that was seriously pursued by a small handful of Troma employees who were always looking for an excuse to blow something up) or I had to go down there and deal with the rats myself. The history of Troma was in that basement. A shit-stained, fucked-up history it may be, but it was a history that Michael Herz and I had built. I couldn&#x2019;t ask anyone to defend that history but me.8 Armed with a shovel (which I cleverly figured would serve double duty as both shit scooper and rat bludgeon), I swung wide the steel doors that led to the cellar. I switched on the single 40-watt bulb that provided what milky light the basement offered. I could see four or five rats stop what they were doing, look me in the eyes, then lazily make their way deeper into the basement. Presumably these were mere sentries, going off to let the others know that some asshole was about to interrupt them. I continued into the darkest recesses of the basement. I walked the rickety pallets to the far door, the door that led into the real heart of darkness. Rat Central. A filthy, damp, pitch black storage area that contained those weird items that tread the fine line between garbage and artifact. Too precious to throw away, but far too useless to ever hope of using again. All around me, I could see the physical reminders of my thirty years with Troma. There was a box containing production schedules and the shooting script from <i>The Battle of Love&#x2019;s Return</i> (1971). I thumbed through the papers, trying to decipher the notes I&#x2019;d written to myself almost thirty years earlier. It just seemed like gibberish now and I wondered if I&#x2019;d ever been able to read them. That would explain a lot about that movie. Stacked nearby were molding stacks of posters from <i>Troma&#x2019;s War</i> (1988). There were all kinds of posters from dozens of different movies but it seemed as if you couldn&#x2019;t turn around without seeing a <i>War</i> poster.9 There were decomposing boxes full of <i>Squeeze Play</i> T-shirts (circa 1980), the computer monitor with the smashed, bloody severed head of Capulet from <i>Tromeo &amp; Juliet</i> (1996), and the costume for Tromie, the Nuclear Squirrel10 from <i>Class of Nuke &#x2019;Em High</i> parts 2 and 3 were precariously balanced like gargoyles atop unmarked boxes. I turned and nearly tripped over a pair of metal film cans, coming ominously close to landing face-first in a mound of petrified rat shit. I examined the can and was not in the least bit surprised to discover that I had almost fallen over the work print of <i>Big Gus, What&#x2019;s the Fuss</i> (1973). My worst movie, arguably the most heinous atrocity ever committed to celluloid, continued to find novel ways to injure and humiliate me. It was the only thing I&#x2019;d found down here that I thought deserved to be locked away and left to collect dust and feces in this dank basement. As I cast my eyes over the collected Tromabilia, all of a sudden I knew with the certainty usually reserved for either the very pious or the very insane that spread out before me was what my thirty plus years in movies boiled down to. All the hours spent on set, all the disappointment when something didn&#x2019;t go according to plan, all the elation when something turned out better than hoped, all the money-men I&#x2019;d had to fellate &#x2026; and what had it got me? An extremely limber throat and tongue and a basement full of neglected crap that was slowly being transformed into a public toilet for every sewer rat in Manhattan. I bent over with my shovel in one hand and an open garbage bag in the other. As I attacked the rat-crap with my shovel, the ancient turds exploded into thick, heavy clouds of dust. The dust immediately coated my ears, eyes, nose, and throat.11 I kept shoveling and, squinting through the putrid dust, saw a huge rat lazily walk past and, I swear to god, salute me with a Bronx cheer, just like the mouse in <i>Tom &amp; Jerry</i> cartoons. <i>Tom &amp; Jerry</i> had been a huge influence on the Troma style of 12 violence. The debt I owed to this thing&#x2019;s animated counterpart didn&#x2019;t prevent me from taking a swing at it with my shovel. The rat seemed unconcerned by this attack and, after staring at me for a few uncomfortable seconds, disappeared between some boxes. As I returned to my shoveling, I wondered, when all is said and done, why the fuck was I even bothering to make movies? It&#x2019;s certainly no way to make money. Harvey Weinstein and I started in the business at around the same time. Now people flocked to him like flies to shit, while I was actually down in the shit. It was getting to be virtually impossible to even get our movies seen. The vast majority of movie theaters in the U.S. are now once again owned and operated by the major studios, who seem intent on forcing the same Tom Cruise blockbuster onto every screen and driving the theaters into bankruptcy (both moral and financial). Smaller mom-and-pop video stores were being pushed out of business by Blockbuster and one or two other giant chains that impose an economic blacklist on Troma and other independent studios.13 And every day seemed to bring news of another independent studio going out of business. The &#x201c;lucky&#x201d; ones merely lost their independence and were absorbed into a gigantic, devil-worshipping international megaconglomerate. More often than not it seemed the only way to make money at this was to sell out your ideals and give up your independence. But it&#x2019;s not always about money. The late, lamented, legendary Sam Arkoff, cofounder of American International Pictures, once told me that the biggest mistake of his life was selling AIP to Filmways (which was later bought by Orion which later went through a spectacular bankruptcy that has fucked up the distribution of hundreds, if not thousands, of movies). <i>If it&#x2019;s not money</i>, I thought to myself as a rat the approximate size and color of a kielbasa ran across my feet, leaving a trail of fragrant droppings, <i>maybe I&#x2019;m doing it for the respect and admiration of others</i>. Yeah, sure. I couldn&#x2019;t even command enough respect to get my own goddamn employees to do the scut work around the office. Maybe I&#x2019;d vomited green Bromo Seltzer on camera once too often to be a truly effective leader. Scraping the shit off my feet, I saw another large, immobile rat on the floor next to me. The rats knew they had control, so it wasn&#x2019;t at all unusual that it wasn&#x2019;t moving. But this one looked far too comfortable. It was either completely at home or dead. &#x201c;Lucky fucker,&#x201d; I muttered and enviously kicked it to make sure it was dead. As my foot hit fur, the rat burst open. Hundreds of spiders erupted from their corpsenest, swarming every which way. Confronted with a plague of rat-born spiders, I did what any pillar of manly American fortitude would do. I squealed like a prison bitch and slammed my shovel down again and again, hitting the floor, my feet, the dead rat, the walls, and, I&#x2019;m fairly sure, at least a couple of spiders. Exhausted, I leaned against the wall. A particularly brave rat, unphased by my spectacular display of martial arts, peered at me from atop a box of SGT. KABUKIMAN FOR PRESIDENT pins from 1992. I recognized the contemptuous look in its eyes from dozens of surly production assistants over the years. Whatever my reasons may have been for starting to make movies, the cold reality was that this is what it boiled down to. There was no glamour when I made movies. There was nothing but hard work to be assigned and, more often than not, returned to my lap. This was the world of filmmaking that I knew. No limousines. No craft services. No imported bottled water to wash the starlet&#x2019;s hair. Just a neverending basement full of shitty, moldy rot that had to be cleaned out. Why the fuck was I doing all this? DISSOLVE TO:14 Thirty-six hours later in the magnificent town of Sitges on the Mediterranean coast of Spain and I have my answer. Every October, the city hosts the Sitges Film Festival, one of the most comprehensive and prestigious horror, science fiction, and fantasy film festivals in the world. I&#x2019;ve been fortunate enough to have movies I&#x2019;ve directed invited here several times. In 1996, Sitges showed <i>Tromeo &amp; Juliet</i> and in 1999, we brought <i>Terror Firmer</i>15 here. This year, they were hosting the world premiere of <i>Citizen Toxie</i>. Not only had the festival flown me over for the occasion, they&#x2019;d also brought along Heidi Sjursen, who plays Toxie&#x2019;s blind wife Sarah in the movie, and Gabe Friedman, the movie&#x2019;s editor. Now it&#x2019;s one thing for a film festival to fly in the director or the star of a movie. But if you think it&#x2019;s commonplace for a festival to fly in a movie&#x2019;s editor, guess again. Editors are notoriously pale, shaky guys who rarely see the light of day. The inhuman amount of hours they spend locked away watching the same footage over and over again causes them to have social graces that are rudimentary at best and a bizarre, unpleasant omnisexuality that makes it very difficult for them to see other people in the flesh without becoming visibly and embarrassingly aroused. Lloyd Kaufman receives a &#x201c;lifetime achievement&#x201d; award in <i>Citizen Toxie</i>. This scene was cut from the film because it was just too damn unbelievable&#x2014;even for Troma. (Doug Sakmann) <i>Citizen Toxie</i> was playing in an amazing 3,000-seat cinema that ranks among the best I&#x2019;ve ever seen. I took the stage to introduce the film and immediately remembered why the fuck I bothered making movies. Here was an auditorium full of enthusiastic men and Gynos16 who were genuinely <i>excited</i> to see a movie. Even more astonishingly, they were excited to see a <i>Troma</i> movie. Here were people applauding and chanting &#x201c;Troma! Troma! Troma!&#x201d;17 Here were fans dressed as Toxie, Kabukiman, and the Tromettes. Not because anyone asked them to, but because they wanted to. One group of fans had started their own website, Villacabras.com, and arrived at Sitges with their own Toxified bottles of champagne called Tromanpagne. Another Spanish fan club, Fester, had made their own Troma T-shirts using images and lines from the script of <i>Terror Firmer</i>. I was gratified and amazed at all the effort the fans had put into showing us their appreciation. Heidi and Gabe were completely overwhelmed. They had no idea Troma had such a far reach.18 I was inspired not only by my renewed connection with the audience but by the other films screening at the festival. Finally, audiences were given the opportunity to see amazing, brilliant movies they&#x2019;d never have a chance to see through ordinary channels. At Sitges, it was possible to go on a three-day movie binge, watching ten films a day with each one better than the last. Movies like Geoffrey Wright&#x2019;s uncut version of <i>Cherry Falls</i>, Santiago Segura&#x2019;s <i>Torrente</i>, Shinya Tsukamoto&#x2019;s <i>Tokyo Fist</i>, and Alex de la Iglesia&#x2019;s <i>Common Wealth</i>. Seeing these masterpieces in such incredible surroundings with audiences who appreciated them was as invigorating as seeing the movies in my youth that first inspired me to be a filmmaker.

Unfortunately this picture was taken two weeks after the <br>Cannes Film Festival in Newark, New Jersey. Finally, I&#x2019;d found the reason I continued to make movies despite the many, many reasons I could come up with for trading in the whole goddamn thing and trying to do something vaguely productive with my remaining years like becoming an air-conditioner repairman. Days earlier I&#x2019;d been risking the plague in ankle-deep rat shit, now, here I was, surrounded by people who appreciated what I&#x2019;d been doing, enjoying free drinks and pot. And I knew that as long as there were people with a passion for watching movies, I would retain my passion for making them. Tromettes publicize Troma movies at the Cannes Film Festival. Troma-tic tip to aspiring filmmakers: Tell the Tromettes you are gay and challenge them to &#x201c;in&#x201d; you!!! (Tartan Burgess) Over the past three decades, I&#x2019;ve directed, produced, written, shot, and/or distributed hundreds of movies and, believe it or not, not all of them received standing ovations, glowing reviews, and orgasmic audiences at prestigious film festivals. In fact, more than a couple died painful, humiliating, protracted deaths. Some of them deserved it. Some of them, I think, deserved better. None of them, good or bad, were easy to make. If you&#x2019;re looking for a book that will help put you in touch with your inner genius and make only good movies while avoiding the bad, keep on a-lookin&#x2019; (and if you find one drop me a line at lloyd@troma. com. I can use all the help I can get). What this book <i>will</i> help you do is avoid having two days worth of abandoned footage because, for whatever reason, everything fell apart on you at the last minute. To make your own damn movie, you have to be equal parts dictator and diplomat. You must be both the visionary storyteller addressing the audience at the film festival and the dickhead shoveling rat shit out of the basement because nobody else would and everything would be lost if it didn&#x2019;t get done. You must be both extravagant artist and penny-pinching asshole.

Love is in the air as spring comes to the small town, but no sooner has Mary Minor &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Haristeen remarried than she is rudely interrupted&#x2014;by murder. And no sooner does the trouble start than curious cats Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, along with corgi Tee Tucker, sink their claws into the case....<br><br> After an unexpected rekindling of their romance, Harry and her veterinarian ex-husband, Fair Haristeen, have happily remarried. But the excitement of their nuptials is quickly overshadowed by the murder of Professor Vincent Forland, a world-famous grape and fungal expert who was in town visiting the local vineyards.<br><br> Within days of giving a lecture on how distilled fungus and cattle diseases are the current basis of chemical warfare, Forland&#x2019;s decapitated body is discovered. After their initial fright, the residents of Crozet believe that this was a political murder and settle back into their routines&#x2013;until a local is also found dead, killed in the same gruesome manner as Professor Forland. Now residents can&#x2019;t help wondering, is this really the work of an&nbsp;outsider&#x2014;or one of their own? <br><br> No longer working in the post office, Harry had just planted a quarter acre of grapes, which fuels her natural curiosity over just what the two murder victims knew and had in common. Once the warmth of spring arrives, the grapevines blossom and Harry&#x2019;s furry entourage discovers the first critical clue. But how can they show the humans what they&#x2019;ve learned?

Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor and keep him in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only to him, so long as ye both shall live?"<br><br>"I will," Harry answered in a clear voice.<br><br>The Reverend Herbert Jones, in his sonorous tone, then asked, "Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?"<br><br>Susan Tucker, next to Harry, said, "I do."<br><br>Fair, smiling, repeated what he had memorized.

Tucker, the corgi, sat on a bench next to Mildred, the organist.<br><br>"<i>Finally</i>," the dog sighed.<br><br>"<i>They're right for each other</i>." Mrs. Murphy had cat's intuition about such matters.<br><br>"<i>They tried it once, the second time should be the charm</i>." Pewter wished the ceremony would speed along, because she was eager to attend the reception. The extravagance of foods thrilled her far more than contemplating human rituals.<br><br>"<i>If you think the farm runs along like a top now, you just wait until Fair puts his back into it. He's strong as an ox.</i>" Tucker had always loved the six-foot-five-inch veterinarian. The feeling was mutual.<br><br>"<i>Does this mean we won't be sleeping on the bed? I mean, do we have to put up with their thrashing around and all that moaning and groaning</i>?" Pewter cherished sleep almost as much as food.<br><br>"<i>Why would it be any different now, Pewts? Flop on the end of the bed and when they're done then go up and sleep on the pillow</i>," Mrs. Murphy replied.<br><br>"<i>Well, if they're married maybe they'll be doing it more, you know</i>?" Pewter considered human physical intimacy an irritation. Then she giggled. "<i>Or less</i>."<br><br>"<i>Won't be any different, except he'll be more relaxed. He's worked so hard to win her back. He'll be happy. Harry really is his great passion</i>." Mrs. Murphy watched as Herb blessed the rings.<br><br>"<i>Is Fair her great passion</i>?" Pewter cocked her head.<br><br>Neither Mrs. Murphy nor Tucker said anything. After long thought, Tucker finally responded, "<i>That's a hard question to answer</i>."<br><br>"<i>See, I don't think he is, even if she is marrying him</i>," Pewter blurted out. "<i>Look at Miranda and Tracy. He's loony about her and she swoons every time she looks at him. I mean, BoomBoom and Alicia, besotted with each other. Cow eyes, you know. But I never see that in Harry</i>."<br><br>"<i>Too rational</i>." Tucker understood Pewter's point.<br><br>"<i>Oh, we've all seen Harry toss reason to the winds. Not often, granted, but she can lose her temper or let her curiosity get the better of her. Judgment flies right out the window</i>." Mrs. Murphy, too, pondered Pewter's observation. "<i>She loves him. She wouldn't be standing there in that pretty dress if she didn't love him. She's</i>," Mrs. Murphy paused, "<i>diffident. Our dear mother gets more excited about ideas, about building a shed or planting redbud clover than she does about people. She likes people well enough and, like I said, she truly loves Fair, but her passions aren't about people. But he knows that. He knows just what he's getting</i>."<br><br>"<i>Guess so. They've known each other since before kindergarten</i>." Tucker noticed Miranda wiping her eyes with a Belgian lace handkerchief. She also saw Paul de Silva holding Tazio Chappars's hand. He obviously was wildly in love with the young, talented architect. Alicia and BoomBoom didn't hold hands, but she saw Alicia give BoomBoom a handkerchief, as the Junoesque blonde was crying, too.<br><br>"<i>Funny, BoomBoom crying, since everyone blamed her for the breakup of Harry's marriage even though they were separated</i>," Tucker remarked.<br><br>"<i>No one can seduce a man who doesn't want to be seduced. Fair was wrong and he paid penance. I say we forget the whole thing. Harry finally has</i>." Mrs. Murphy was glad that Harry and BoomBoom had reclaimed a friendship out of painful circumstances.<br><br>"<i>Guess BoomBoom and Alicia can't get married, huh</i>?" Pewter twitched her tail, massive boredom setting in along with a grumbling stomach.<br><br>"<i>They can, sort of, but the state doesn't recognize it</i>." Tucker shifted her weight on the bench, which made Mildred Potter, the organist, pat her on the head.<br><br>"<i>Why do people get married? We don't. It's such an expense, a big public display, and it costs a bloody fortune. Can't they just pair off and be done with it? Think of all the chicken and salmon and tuna and catnip you could buy with that money</i>." Pewter honed in on her passion.<br><br>"<i>This wedding isn't that expensive, because it's a remarriage</i>." Tucker was getting hungry herself.<br><br>"<i>Ha. The reception is going to cost about six thousand dollars. Probably more once the bar bill comes in. That's a lot of tuna</i>," Pewter said.<br><br>"<i>There's more than tuna at stake for humans. Marriage establishes paternity so a man isn't putting a nickel in another man's meter</i>." Mrs. Murphy laughed. " '<i>Course, now with DNA, paternity can be established in ways that don't please all men. You play, you pay. They can no longer claim the baby isn't theirs</i>." She paused. "<i>The whole marriage thing is so ingrained in society that they can't really do without it. Doesn't even matter if they have children. It's something you've got to do</i>."<br><br>"<i>Like death and taxes</i>." Pewter giggled.<br><br>"<i>Aren't you glad you don't have to go through all this rigmarole</i>?" Tucker sighed. "<i>I'm happy Harry is marrying Fair, but it is exhausting</i>."<br><br>"<i>Who wants to be human? If there is reincarnation I'm coming back as myself</i>." Pewter puffed out her gray chest.<br><br>"<i>My, my, don't we think a lot of ourselves</i>." Mrs. Murphy slyly batted at Pewter.<br><br>"<i>Oh, and you'd like to come back as a caterpillar</i>?" Pewter sassed.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy lashed out, a real whack.<br><br>Pewter struck back.<br><br>"Hey, hey, you two!" Mildred cautioned them, because it would be a long tumble down into the congregation.<br><br>Just as Herb uttered, "Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder," the people gathered below were treated to a hissing fit of such volume that a few heads tilted upward. Harry cast her eyes to behold the spectacle of Pewter giving Mrs. Murphy such a swat that the tiger cat slipped over the side of the balcony, hanging on by her claws.<br><br>"Dear God," she sighed.<br><br>"Little pagans," Herb whispered, which made Fair laugh.<br><br>With heroic effort, Mrs. Murphy hoisted herself up onto the balcony railing. Pewter shot off the railing, hit the organist's bench with all fours, endured a reprimand from Mildred and a yap from Tucker as she leapt onto the keys, which produced a mass of discordant notes throughout lovely St. Luke's Lutheran Church.<br><br>She then soared off the organ as Mrs. Murphy, in hot pursuit, gained on her. Up to the last row of the balcony, down to the exit, thundering down the carpeted stairs, Pewter skidded across the highly polished vestibule floor, knocking over the lectern with the red leather visitor's book opened. The book hit the floor. Mrs. Murphy left a few claw marks as she scrambled over the book. Pewter then turned a ninety-degree angle, bolting down the center aisle of the church.<br><br>BoomBoom reached out to grab her, but Pewter eluded the bejeweled hand, as did Mrs. Murphy. The two crazed felines headed straight for the nuptial pair.<br><br>Tucker had sense enough not to stop either cat. She watched with fascination, as did Mildred.<br><br>"You're a good doggy," Mildred crooned between her laughs.<br><br>"<i>Yes, I am</i>."<br><br>"<i>I will kill you. I will kill you on Harry's wedding day</i>!" Mrs. Murphy shouted.<br><br>"<i>Gotta catch me first</i>." Pewter, realizing she was the center of attention, was loving the limelight, quite oblivious to the discipline that might follow.<br><br>Herb bravely continued, and as he was pronouncing Fair and Harry husband and wife he rolled his eyes skyward, imploring the Lord not only to bless those two humans but to bless the two cats in quite a different way.<br><br>Pewter ducked under Harry's train. Mrs. Murphy wiggled right under. Pewter then emerged from the back of Harry's train with such force that Fair held on to her as Herb ended the ceremony with ". . . that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen."<br><br>Before Fair kissed his bride, they both watched Pewter land on the altar. She crouched behind the large gold cross. Mrs. Murphy landed on the altar, as well, the two towering floral displays on either side of the cross swaying unpredictably. The cats fought each other on either side of the cross.<br><br>Fair whispered, "Honey, let me kiss you before they wreck the place."<br><br>He kissed her and she kissed back, and when they broke the kiss, they just laughed until the tears came to their eyes. By now everyone was mesmerized, and it was dawning on Pewter that as much as she adored all these eyes upon her there might be hell to pay.<br><br>"<i>She started it</i>!" Pewter bellowed.<br><br>"<i>I did not, you fat fat water rat</i>!"

Small tables set up under the trees each had a lovely spring-flower arrangement. The food was truly superb, and Patricia Kluge and Bill Moses supplied all the wines from their Kluge Estates Vineyard. Over two hundred guests came to celebrate this glorious day. Even Mrs. Murphy and Pewter were forgiven as Harry fed them bits of turkey, ham, roast pork, and salmon.<br><br>She said to Fair, "No one will forget our wedding day."<br><br>He'd just given Tucker a whole sweet potato as people toasted the bride and groom.

This Monday, while not blizzard weather, proved cold enough for scarf, gloves, Barbour coat, and Thinsulate-lined work boots, all of which Harry wore as she checked the mares and foals. The mares, bequeathed to her and Fair by a friend who died quite young, unexpectedly, each delivered beautiful foals. Harry could never have afforded the stud fees. She marveled at how correct the three fillies and one colt were as they nuzzled up to their respective mothers.<br><br>Most couples marry in June; October is the second-most popular month, and the Christmas season is also popular. Since Harry worked the farm and Fair, a vet, specialized in equine reproduction, April was the best choice.

So many horse injuries are fence-related. Checking the fences every day was part of her routine. The health of her animals came first.<br><br>Tucker trotted behind Harry. Mrs. Murphy and Pewter stayed in the barn, the excuse being that the mouse population had mushroomed out of control. The reality was that Pewter didn't like cold and Mrs. Murphy wanted a good gossip with Simon, the possum living in the hayloft.<br><br>Also living in the hayloft was Flatface, a great horned owl, and Matilda, a huge slumbering blacksnake.<br><br>In Pewter's defense, she did perch on the tack trunk in the heated tack room, peering down at the cleverly hidden mouse hole behind the trunk.

"<i>Harry told Fair that every day with him was a honeymoon, besides which they'd been married before so why not just press on? I think they'll take a little vacation midsummer.

Growing up alongside Margaret wasn't easy: Eileen often found herself in situations that were simultaneously awkward, hilarious, and heartbreaking. For example, losing a blue plastic hairbrush could leave Margaret inconsolable for hours, and a quiet Sunday Mass might provoke an outburst of laughter, swearing, or dancing.</p><p><i>How to Be a Sister</i> begins when Eileen, after several years in New Mexico, has just moved back to the Pacific Northwest, where she grew up. Being 1,600 miles away had allowed Eileen to avoid the question that has dogged her since birth: What is she going to do about Margaret? Now, Eileen must grapple with this question once again as she tentatively tries to reconnect with Margaret. How can she have a relationship with someone who can&#x2019;t drive, send email, or telephone? What role will Eileen play in Margaret&#x2019;s life as their parents age, and after they die? Will she remain in Margaret's life, or walk away?</p><p>A deeply felt, impeccably written memoir, <i>How to Be a Sister</i> will speak to siblings, parents, friends, and teachers of people with autism and to anyone who sometimes struggles to connect with someone difficult or different.</p></p><p><b><b>Eileen Garvin</b> was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest.

The focus instead is squarely on the author&#x2019;s sister, Margaret, diagnosed as autistic at 3 years old. . . . Garvin&#x2019;s storytelling abilities are strong, and her fierce, protective love for Margaret, whom she brings to stinging life on the page, gives this book real power.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p> A marvelous, harrowing, life-affirming book.

Bravo to Eileen for seeing and for enabling the rest of us to witness her sister&#x2019;s creativity, purpose, and profoundly independent path.&#x201d;<br> <b>Judy Karasik,</b> coauthor of <i>The Ride Together: A Brother and Sister's Memoir of Autism in the Family</i></p><p> Eileen Garvin has written a deeply reflective, generous book about her relationship with her older sister, Margaret, who has autism.

Yet despite the enduring appeal of these works from the Parthenon to Michelangelo&#x2019;s <i>David</i> to Picasso&#x2019;s <i>Guernica</i> histories of both art and democracy have ignored this phenomenon. Millions have admired the artworks covered in this book but relatively few know why they were commissioned, what was happening in the culture that produced them, or what they were meant to achieve. Even scholars who have studied them for decades often miss the big picture by viewing them in isolation from a larger story of human striving.<br><br><i>David&#x2019;s Sling</i> places into context ten canonical works of art executed to commemorate the successes of free societies that exerted political and economic influence far beyond what might have been expected of them.

John F. Kennedy did not live to write his memoirs; Fidel Castro will not reveal what he knows; and the records of the Soviet Union have long been sealed from public view: Of the most frightening episode of the Cold War--the Cuban Missile Crisis--we have had an incomplete picture. When did Castro embrace the Soviet Union? What proposals were put before the Kremlin through Kennedy's back-channel diplomacy? How close did we come to nuclear war? These questions have now been answered for the first time. This important and controversial book draws the missing half of the story from secret Soviet archives revealed exclusively by the authors, including the files of Nikita Khrushchev and his leadership circle. Contained in these remarkable documents are the details of over forty secret meetings between Robert Kennedy and his Soviet contact, records of Castro's first solicitation of Soviet favor, and the plans, suspicions, and strategies of Khrushchev. This unique research opportunity has allowed the authors to tell the complete, fascinating, and terrifying story of the most dangerous days of the last half-century.</p><p>The Berlin Wall has been rubble for a decade and the memories of the cold war are growing dim. And yet no one is ever likely to forget the Cuban Missile crisis of October 1962, when the world stood on the brink of full-scale nuclear war as the Soviet Union and America locked horns off the coast of Florida. The Soviet navy set sail for Cuba loaded with nuclear warheads for their newly constructed missile bases, precipitating the crisis. After 10 days of high tension, the Soviet Union backed down and the warheads were sent back home. War was averted, but up until now, no one has ever been too certain just how close the world came to catastrophe. Kennedy was assassinated long before he could write his memoirs, Castro's lips are sealed, and the Soviet archives were a closed book.<p> Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali have taken advantage of recent unrestricted access to Soviet records and performed painstaking detective work to fill the gaps in the historical record. Some of the tension of the narrative is lost, because we know the outcome; even so, they give penetrating insights as they reconstruct the drama step by step. We learn that the Kremlin did seriously consider launching a nuclear attack on the U.S.: the appropriate orders were discussed and Khrushchev spent the night of October 22 in his office so he could be on hand to cable his authorization. Some of the most interesting facts to emerge, however, are those concerning John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert. JFK had always previously been portrayed as something of a parochial gung-ho type, but this, it emerges, was merely a public persona designed to appease the Pentagon hawks. At the same time JFK was talking about a Cuban invasion, he and his brother were engaging in a more secret policy of appeasement through the Soviet ambassador. Fortunately for all of us, diplomacy won the day. In recent years, JFK has been somewhat discredited as a leader for his unpleasant sexual carryings-on and corruption. It may just be that this view is as incomplete as his portrayal as the saintly "King of Camelot".

All of the best essays by this giant of liberty are here, 1000 plus pages of it, but in a compact package that it is still easy to read. In fact, it is a joy to hold and even more to read because the text just jumps off the page.</p> <p> Putting this together was a challenge but one we accepted because many people said that our two-volume hardback, though beautiful, was too costly and cumbersome. For some collectors, this was great, but what about students and people who read on the subway, or on lunch break, or just want to throw the book into an overnight bag for a quick trip somewhere? </p> <p>We can't be more pleased at the result. This is the Bastiat Collection that the world has needed.</p></p><p><p>Claude Fr�d�ric Bastiat was an economist and publicist of breathtaking intellectual energy and massive historical influence. He was born in Bayonne, France on June 29th, 1801. After the middle-class Revolution of 1830, Bastiat became politically active and was elected Justice of the Peace in 1831 and to the Council General (county-level assembly) in 1832. He was elected to the national legislative assembly after the French Revolution of 1848.</p> <p>Bastiat was inspired by and routinely corresponded with Richard Cobden and the English Anti-Corn Law League and worked with free-trade associations in France. Bastiat wrote sporadically starting in the 1830s, but in 1844 he launched his amazing publishing career when an article on the effects of protectionism on the French and English people was published in the Journal des Economistes which was held to critical acclaim.</p> <p>The bulk of his remarkable writing career that so inspired the early generation of English translators and so many more is contained in this collection.</p> <p>If we were to take the greatest economists from all ages and judge them on the basis of their theoretical rigor, their influence on economic education, and their impact in support of the free-market economy, then Fr�d�ric Bastiat would be at the top of the list.</p> <p>As Murray N. Rothbard noted: "Bastiat was indeed a lucid and superb writer, whose brilliant and witty essays and fables to this day are remarkable and devastating demolitions of protectionism and of all forms of government subsidy and control. He was a truly scintillating advocate of an untrammeled free market."</p> <p>This book bring together his greatest works and represents the early generation of English translations. These translators were like Bastiat himself, people from the private sector who had a love of knowledge and truth and who altered their careers to vigorously pursue intellectual ventures, scholarly publishing, and advocacy of free trade.</p> <p>Thus does this collection, totally 1,000 pages plus extensive indexes, represent some of the best economics ever written. He was the first, and one of the very few, to be able to convincingly communicate the basic propositions of economics.</p> <p>The vast majority of people who have learned anything about economics have relied on Bastiat or publications that were influenced by his work. This collection possibly more than anything ever written about economics is the antidote for economic illiteracy regarding such things as the inadvisability of tariffs and price controls, and everyone from the novice to the Ph.D. economist will benefit from reading it.</p> <p>The collection consists of three sections, the first of which contains his best-known essays. In That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen, Bastiat equips the reader to become an economist in the first paragraph and then presents the story of the broken window where a hoodlum is thought to create jobs and prosperity by breaking windows. Bastiat solves the quandary of prosperity via destruction by noting that while the apparent prosperity is seen, what is unseen is that which would have been produced had the windows not been broken.</p> <p>Professor J�rg Guido H�lsmann credits Bastiat for discovering the counterfactual method, which allowed Bastiat to show that destruction (and a variety of government policies) is actually the path to poverty, not prosperity. This lesson is then applied to a variety of more complex cases and readers will never be able to deny that scarcity exists and will always hopefully remember that every policy has an opportunity cost. If nothing else, they will not believe as is often claimed that earthquakes, hurricanes, and wars lead to prosperity.</p>Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Literature Workshop: Teaching Texts and Their Readers</h2><p><p>In this groundbreaking book, Sheridan Blau introduces the literature workshop as the most effective approach to solving many of the classic instructional problems that perplex beginning and veteran teachers of literature.

Ricci's missionary career indeed constituted a key moment in modern history, for it was through his examples and recommendations that the Jesuits in China collectively adopted an accommodative approach to Chinese culture and embarked on various projects of cultural translation that resulted in the first wave of sustained interactions between Chinese and European civilizations. Instructors and students alike will benefit greatly from Hsia's lucid introduction, which sets Ricci's life story against the broader background of Portuguese Asia, Catholic renewal, and late Ming China; the pithy, informative introductory statements preceding each document; a chronological chart of major relevant events; and an excellent annotated bibliography of primary and secondary sources in multiple languages. <b>This is a very affordable text produced at the highest academic standards</b>."<br> &#x2014;Qiong Zhang, Associate Professor of History, Wake Forest University</p><p>R.

Hsia offers a clear and concise overview of the key figures in this crucial episode of intercultural encounter: the first intellectual and cultural meeting of Europeans and Chinese. . . . In addition to providing a broad vision of the European and Asian contexts for Ricci&#x2019;s work in the introductory essay, Hsia gives a valuable selection of documents from both Chinese and Western sources in translation . . . [including] items that genuinely demonstrate the two sides of this cultural exchange."<br> &#x2014;Liam Matthew Brockey, Professor of History, Michigan State University<br><br>"[A] valuable contribution to the field. Paired with a suitable companion volume, this book can lead to many fruitful and critical discussions about the nature of East&#x2013;West encounters in the early modern period. This alone makes Hsia's book a valuable addition to the field of early modern history."<br> &#x2014;Michael Laver,&nbsp;Rochester Institute of Technology, in&nbsp;<i>Education About Asia</i><br><br>"Hsia's collection of source materials allows the reader to formulate his or her own conclusions&#x2014;positive or pejorative&#x2014;about the East-West encounter between Ricci and China. . . . [W]hat gives this book utility is the judiciously chosen series of original documents, some of which Hsia himself has translated in order to fill in areas previously missing in Ricci studies. Among the documents that more effectively reveal how Matteo Ricci formed his opinions of Chinese religion and influenced his missionary 'method,' are those that recount his discussions with Chinese Buddhist clerics and Confucian literati. . . . Such documents as this are useful examples of how East-West intellectual dialogue can be both creatively informative, while also being a frustrating illustration of how these disparate modes of thinking elude one another in veils of misunderstanding. That Hsia has now published these critical documents in one volume is a significant service to the field of China studies. [A] welcome addition to the scholarly project of better understanding how the Jesuit mission to China planted the seeds of cultural engagement and dialogue that have grown into the academic disciplines that look critically at Asia's historical past and cultural present."<br> &#x2014;Anthony E.

For therapists interested in exploring the ways that sandplay facilitates growth and healing and in expanding their reservoir of therapeutic tools by incorporating sandplay into their practices, this practical handbook will be an invaluable resource.<br><br> After presenting the history and benefits of sandplay, the authors describe how to create a sandplay therapy room, including choosing sand containers, finding evocative objects, and displaying objects appropriately. They provide detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to conduct spontaneous and directed sandplay therapy sessions with individuals, couples, children, and families.<br><br> Various ways of recording the creation of a sand world are described, so that both the process and the product will be saved even after the sand tray is dismantled.Not only does the book establish the foundation for incorporating sandplay into the reader's current psychotherapeutic practice, but it will also stimulate the creative process of the professional. Like the client who sees internal and interpersonal dynamics and dilemmas pictured in the sand, the therapist will find that this powerful experiential tool reveals insights, information, and avenues to explore.<br><br> The authors illustrate the process with numerous sandplay experiences with clients. They also discuss clients for whom sandplay is contraindicated and some problems that might arise.

Some singularity theorists predict that if the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop at its current dizzying rate, the singularity could come about in the middle of the present century. Murray Shanahan offers an introduction to the idea of the singularity and considers the ramifications of such a potentially seismic event.</p><p>Shanahan's aim is not to make predictions but rather to investigate a range of scenarios. Whether we believe that singularity is near or far, likely or impossible, apocalypse or utopia, the very idea raises crucial philosophical and pragmatic questions, forcing us to think seriously about what we want as a species. </p><p>Shanahan describes technological advances in AI, both biologically inspired and engineered from scratch. Once human-level AI&#x2015;theoretically possible, but difficult to accomplish&#x2015;has been achieved, he explains, the transition to superintelligent AI could be very rapid. Shanahan considers what the existence of superintelligent machines could mean for such matters as personhood, responsibility, rights, and identity. Some superhuman AI agents might be created to benefit humankind; some might go rogue. (Is Siri the template, or HAL?) The singularity presents both an existential threat to humanity and an existential opportunity for humanity to transcend its limitations.

Covey presents a holistic, integrated, principle-centered approach for solving personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and pointed anecdotes, Covey reveals a step-by-step pathway for living with fairness, integrity, honesty, and human dignity -- principles that give us the security to adapt to change and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates.</p><p>Anyone who thinks the audiocassette adaptation of Stephen Covey's bestseller, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, is a shortcut to reading the book has another thing coming. As a preview, the cassette is worth every one of its 90 minutes; as a substitute for the original, it will only leave you wishing for the rest. There's a reason <i>7 Habits</i> has sold more than 5 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. Serious work has obviously gone into it, and serious change can likely come out of it--but only with constant discipline and steadfast commitment. As the densely packed tape makes immediately clear, this is no quick fix for what's ailing us in our personal and professional lives.<p> The tape opens to the silky-smooth, overtrained voice of the female narrator, who's responsible for tying together audio clips from actual Covey seminars. Leaving aside the occasional attempts at promoting Covey and his institute, her script does a first-rate job of making sense of Covey's own intense, analogy-rich style of explaining his habits. There's nothing simple about his approach to becoming an effective person. The first three habits alone--which have to do with personal responsibility, leadership, and self-management--could take years to master. Yet the last four are unattainable, the narrator insists, if you can't acquire the personal security--the "inner core," says Covey--that presumably comes from a mastery of the foundation.</p><p> Throughout our lessons, Covey's presence is both learned and thoroughly appealing. He drops references to the likes of Socrates, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Frost with the aplomb of an English professor. And his knack for mixing everyday stories with abstract concepts manages to clarify difficult issues while respecting our intelligence. You could argue that the cassette is nothing more than a clever marketing tool for selling another few million copies of the book. But, even at that, it's worth the investment in time and concentration: in the end, we're moved to learn more about integrating all seven habits in our struggle to become better and, yes, more effective people. (Running time: 1.5 hours, one cassette) <i>--Ann Senechal</i></p><i>The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People</i> is a comprehensive program based on developing an awareness of how perceptions and assumptions hinder success---in business as well as presonal relationships. Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. Stephen R. Covey is the most respected motivator in the business world today.

Suffice it to say, this fourth edition brings together the results of all the most recent scholarship on these families, expanding the limits of what is presently known and opening up possibilities for research beyond the sixth generation.</p> <p>The concluding volume contains accounts of forty-six pre-1625 Virginia settlers or members of the Virginia Company of London whose families later came to the colony, with thirty-six of them traced to the sixth generation. Individuals ranging from R-Z (Reynolds to Zouche) identified in the work must have been resident in Virginia during the period 1607-1624/25 or members of the Virginia Company of London in order to be designated "adventurers," and it is their descendants alone who qualify for membership in one of the most distinguished hereditary societies in America, the Order of First Families of Virginia. <i>Adventurers of Purse and Person</i> is their story, a collection of genealogies of all adventurers with proven descents into the sixth generation.</p></p><p></p><h2>Firehouse</h2><p><b>One of America's most distinguished reporters and historians offers the deeply moving personal story of Engine 40, Ladder 35 -- located on the West Side of Manhattan near Lincoln Center -- and the absolute sacrifice its firefighters made on September 11, 2001. </b><br>On the morning of September 11, 2001, two rigs carrying thirteen men set out from this firehouse: twelve of them would never return.<br><br><i>Firehouse</i> takes us to the epicenter of the tragedy. Through the kind of intimate portraits that are Halberstam's trademark, we watch the day unfold--the men called to duty while their families wait anxiously for news of them. In addition, we come to understand the culture of the firehouse itself: why gifted men do this; why, in so many instances, they are eager to follow in their fathers' footsteps and serve in so dangerous a profession; and why, more than anything else, it is not just a job, but a calling.<br><br>This is journalism-as-history at its best, the story of what happens when one small institution gets caught in an apocalyptic day. <i>Firehouse</i> is a book that will move readers as few others have in our time. <br>More than 6 years after his death <b>David Halberstam</b> remains one of this country's most respected journalists and revered authorities on American life and history in the years since WWII. A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his groundbreaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.</p><p>Thirteen men from Engine 40, Ladder 35 firehouse initially responded to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; only one survived. Located near Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the firehouse was known for its rich tradition and strong leadership. This gripping book details the actions of the 13 men on that horrific day and the heartbreaking aftermath--the search for the bodies, the efforts of their families to deal with overwhelming grief, and the guilt and conflicting emotions of the surviving members of the firehouse. The book is also about the men themselves and the tight bond and sense of duty and honor that held them together. David Halberstam does a masterful job of illustrating the inner workings of a firehouse, with its traditions, routines, and complex social structure that in many ways resembles a "vast extended second family--rich, warm, joyous, and supportive, but on occasion quite edgy as well, with all the inevitable tensions brought on by so many forceful men living so closely together over so long a period of time." He also explains why so many men choose this life despite the high risk, relatively low pay, and physical and emotional demands of the job.<p> Halberstam and his family live three and a half blocks from Engine 40, Ladder 35, and he writes of these 13 men in such a loving and precise way that he could be describing members of his own clan. Deeply felt and emotional, <i>Firehouse</i> is a tribute to these decent, honorable, and heroic men and a celebration of their selflessness not only as firefighters but also as husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, and friends. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><strong>David Halberstam</strong> was one of America's most distinguished journalists and historians.

At the age of 13 Pella Marsh loses her mother and her home on the scorched husk that is planet Earth. Her sorrowing family emigrates to the Planet of the Archbuilders, whose mysterious inhabitants have names like Lonely Dumptruck and Hiding Kneel<i>&#x2014;</i>and a civilization that and frightens their human visitors.&nbsp;<br> On this new world, spikily independent Pella becomes as uneasy envoy between two species. And at the same time is unwilling drawn to a violent loner who embodies all the paranoid machismo of the frontier ethic. Combining the tragic grandeur of John Ford's <i>The Searchers </i>and the sexual tension of <i>Lolita</i>&nbsp;and transporting them to a planet light years, <i>Girl in Landscape</i>&nbsp;is a tour de force.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p>Science-fiction writers attempting coming-of-age stories have seldom risked showing the stew of loneliness, anger, and angst that really characterizes adolescence. Jonathan Lethem, on the other hand, avoids the plucky sidekick syndrome and instead gives us breathtakingly realistic Pella Marsh, a girl at that awful and wonderful crux in her life just before people start calling her &#34;woman.&#34; Her broken family has just moved to a newly settled planet, with strange and passive natives and the decaying remnants of a great civilization. Something in the alien environment soon enables Pella to telepathically travel, hidden in the bodies of inconspicuous &#34;household deer,&#34; into the homes of her fellow settlers. She inevitably discovers the seamy side of humanity--loss of innocence eloquently portrayed. Don&#39;t read this book on a dark day, as there&#39;s not very much sunshine in here. The entire planet is covered with ruins: ruined towns, ruined hopes and dreams, ruined families. For a rare dose of SF realism, this is a fantastic read, full of raw (but not explicit) sexuality and the unhappy hierarchies of childhood. Forget about cheerful settlers moving in next door to helpful indigenous life forms. This is what the planetary frontiers will be. No matter how far away from Earth we may travel, we&#39;ll still be the same dirty, disappointing, beautiful monsters.Anyone who wonders why Jonathan Lethem is the only novelist to be included among Newsweek's "100 People for the New Century" need only read his deliriously original new book, a science fiction/Western that combines the tragic momentum of The Searchers with the sexual tension of Lolita. <br>At the age of 13, Pella Marsh emigrates with her family to the Planet of the Archbuilders. These enigmatic aborigines have names like Lonely Dumptruck and and Hiding Kneel--and a civilization that baffles and frightens their human visitors. <br>As the spikily independent Pella becomes an uneasy envoy between two species, Girl in Landscape deftly interweaves themes of exploration and otherness, loss and sexual awakening.</p><h2>Simpsons Comics Madness (Simpsons Comic Compilations)</h2><p><p><strong> From the madcap mind of Matt Groening comes the kookiest collection of Simpsons Comics yet!

When Satan told Eve nothing would happen if she bit the apple, that was disinformation. But the rise of social media has made disinformation even more pervasive and pernicious in our current era. In a disturbing turn of events, governments are increasingly using disinformation to create their own false narratives, and democracies are proving not to be very good at fighting it. <br><br> </p><p>During the final three years of the Obama administration, Richard Stengel, the former editor of <i>Time</i> and an Under Secretary of State, was on the front lines of this new global information war. At the time, he was the single person in government tasked with unpacking, disproving, and combating both ISIS&#x2019;s messaging and Russian disinformation. Then, in 2016, as the presidential election unfolded, Stengel watched as Donald Trump used disinformation himself, weaponizing the grievances of Americans who felt left out by modernism. In fact, Stengel quickly came to see how all three players had used the same playbook: ISIS sought to make Islam great again; Putin tried to make Russia great again; and we all know about Trump. <br><br> </p><p>In a narrative that is by turns dramatic and eye-opening, <i>Information Wars</i> walks readers through of this often frustrating battle. Stengel moves through Russia and Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and introduces characters from Putin to Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Mohamed bin Salman to show how disinformation is impacting our global society. He illustrates how ISIS terrorized the world using social media, and how the Russians launched a tsunami of disinformation around the annexation of Crimea &#x2013; a scheme that became the model for their interference with the 2016 presidential election. An urgent book for our times, <i>Information Wars</i> stresses that we must find a way to combat this ever growing threat to democracy. <br></p></p><p>Richard Stengel was the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs from 2013-2016. Before working at the State Department, he was the Editor of TIME for seven years, from 2006-2013. From 1992 to 1994, he collaborated with Nelson Mandela on the South African leader's autobiography <i>Long Walk to Freedom</i>. Stengel later wrote <i>Mandela's Way,</i> a <i>New York Times best-seller</i>, on his experience working with Mandela. He is the author of several other books, including <i>January Sun</i>, a book about life in a small South African town as well as <i>You're Too Kind: A Brief History of Flattery.</i> He is an NBC/MSNBC analyst and lives in New York.<b>Praise for <i>Information Wars</i>:</b><p>&#x201c;With the eye of a historian and the passion of a man in the arena, Richard Stengel has given us a compelling and illuminating memoir of his time at the highest levels in the fight against disinformation and for American values. Richly observed and thoughtfully rendered, Stengel&#x2019;s book is essential reading.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Jon Meacham</b></p><p> &#x201c;<i>Information Wars</i> is a gripping insider account of the U.S. government&#x2019;s struggle to understand and fight back against a new generation of online threats from extremist messaging and Russian disinformation.

Albright</b></p><p> &#x201c;With colorful behind-the-scenes stories and razor-sharp insights, Stengel provides the first insider report from the front lines of the disinformation wars waged by Russia and ISIS. At the heart of the struggle was the way the internet allowed people to weaponize grievances, as Donald Trump did in his campaign. Countering this trend is the most crucial challenge for our democracy and free society. Stengel shows how we&#x2019;ve failed and what we can do in the future.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Walter Isaacson</b></p><p> &#x201c;<i>Information Wars</i> ought to be a wake-up call.

This knotty dilemma is the subject of&nbsp;Michael Foley's&nbsp;wry and accessible investigation into how the desirable states of well-being and satisfaction are constantly undermined by modern life.&nbsp;He examines the elusive condition of happiness common to philosophy, spiritual teachings, and contemporary psychology, then shows how these are becoming increasingly difficult to apply in a world of high expectations. The common challenges of earning a living, maintaining a relationship, and aging are becoming battlegrounds of existential angst and self-loathing in a culture that demands conspicuous consumption, high-octane partnerships, and perpetual youth. Ultimately, rather than denouncing and rejecting the age, Foley presents an entertaining strategy of not just accepting but embracing today's world&#x2014;finding happiness in its absurdity.</p><p><b>Michael Foley</b> is a poet and novelist whose titles includ <i>Beyond</i><i>&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Getting Used to Not Being Remarkable</i>."Delivers well-judged wisdom."&nbsp; &#x2014;Oliver James, author, <i>They F*** You Up</i><br><br>"Achingly funny and wise . . . vastly entertaining."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Daily Mail</i><br><br>"Michael Foley's entertaining, intelligent book may just help you get over yourself. . . .

For whom did Jesus die? This book introduces readers to four prevailing views on divine providence, with particular attention to the question of who Jesus died to save (the extent of the atonement) and if or how God determines who will be saved (predestination).But this book does not merely answer readers&#x2019; questions. Four Views on Divine Providence helps readers think theologically about all the issues involved in exploring this doctrine. The point-counterpoint format reveals the assumptions and considerations that drive equally learned and sincere theologians to sharp disagreement. It unearths the genuinely decisive issues beneath an often superficial debate. Volume contributors are Paul Helseth (God causes every creaturely event that occurs); William Lane Craig (through his &#x201c;middle knowledge,&#x201d; God controls the course of worldly affairs without predetermining any creatures&#x2019; free decisions); Ron Highfield (God controls creatures by liberating their decision-making); and Gregory Boyd (human decisions can be free only if God neither determines nor knows what they will be).

In <i>Gender Talk</i> Johnnetta Betsch Cole and Beverly Guy-Sheftall argue powerfully that the only way to defeat this legacy is to focus on the intersection of race and gender. <br><br>Examining why the &#x201c;race problem&#x201d; has become so male-centered and how this has opened a deep divide between Black women and men, the authors turn to their own lives, offering intimate accounts of their experiences as daughters, wives, and leaders. They examine pivotal moments in African American history when race and gender issues collided with explosive results. Along the way, they present the testimonies of a large and influential group of Black women and men, including Byllye Avery, Derrick A. Bell, Farai Chideya, Kimberl� Crenshaw, Michael Eric Dyson, Marcia Gillespie, bell hooks, and Faye Wattleton.

The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation's communism as both criminal and philistine. He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union's top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6. For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States's nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky's name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain's obviously top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets.&nbsp;<br><br> Unfolding the delicious three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky's nail-biting escape from Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre's latest may be his best yet. Like the greatest novels of John le Carr�, it brings readers deep into a world of treachery and betrayal, where the lines bleed between the personal and the professional, and one man's hatred of communism had the power to change the future of nations.</p><p><b>Ben Macintyre</b>&nbsp;is a writer-at-large for&nbsp;<i>The Times of London</i>&nbsp;and the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>A Spy Among Friends</i>,&nbsp;<i>Double Cross</i>,&nbsp;<i>Operation Mincemeat</i>,&nbsp;<i>Agent Zigzag</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Rogue Heroes</i>, among other books. Macintyre has also written and presented BBC documentaries of his work.Chapter 1<br><br> The KGB<br><br> Oleg Gordievsky was born into the KGB: shaped by it, loved by it, twisted, damaged, and very nearly destroyed by it. The Soviet spy service was in his heart and in his blood. His father worked for the intelligence service all his life, and wore his KGB uniform every day, including weekends. The Gordievskys lived amid the spy fraternity in a designated apartment block, ate special food reserved for officers, and spent their free time socializing with other spy families. Gordievsky was a child of the KGB.<br><br> The KGB&#x2014;the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti, or committee of state security&#x2014;was the most complex and far-reaching intelligence agency ever created. The direct successor of Stalin&#x2019;s spy network, it combined the roles of foreign- and domestic-intelligence gathering, internal security enforcement, and state police. Oppressive, mysterious, and ubiquitous, the KGB penetrated and controlled every aspect of Soviet life. It rooted out internal dissent, guarded the Communist leadership, mounted espionage and counterintelligence operations against enemy powers, and cowed the peoples of the USSR into abject obedience. It recruited agents and planted spies worldwide, gathering, buying, and stealing military, political, and scientific secrets from anywhere and everywhere. At the height of its power, with more than one million officers, agents, and informants, the KGB shaped Soviet society more profoundly than any other institution.<br><br> To the West, the initials were a byword for internal terror and external aggression and subversion, shorthand for all the cruelty of a totalitarian regime run by a faceless official mafia. But the KGB was not regarded that way by those who lived under its stern rule. Certainly it inspired fear and obedience, but the KGB was also admired as a Praetorian guard, a bulwark against Western imperialist and capitalist aggression, and the guardian of Communism. Membership in this elite and privileged force was a source of admiration and pride. Those who joined the service did so for life. &#x201c;There is no such thing as a former KGB man,&#x201d; the former KGB officer Vladimir Putin once said. This was an exclusive club to join&#x2014;and an impossible one to leave. Entering the ranks of the KGB was an honor and a duty to those with sufficient talent and ambition to do so.<br><br> Oleg Gordievsky never seriously contemplated doing anything else.<br><br> His father, Anton Lavrentyevich Gordievsky, the son of a railway worker, had been a teacher before the revolution of 1917 transformed him into a dedicated, unquestioning Communist, a rigid enforcer of ideological orthodoxy. &#x201c;The Party was God,&#x201d; his son later wrote, and the older Gordievsky never wavered in his devotion, even when his faith demanded that he take part in unspeakable crimes. In 1932, he helped enforce the &#x201c;Sovietization&#x201d; of Kazakhstan, organizing the expropriation of food from peasants to feed the Soviet armies and cities. Around 1.5 million people perished in the resulting famine. Anton saw state-induced starvation at close quarters. That year, he joined the office of state security, and then the NKVD, the People&#x2019;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Stalin&#x2019;s secret police and the precursor of the KGB. An officer in the political directorate, he was responsible for political discipline and indoctrination. Anton married Olga Nikolayevna Gornova, a twenty-four-year-old statistician, and the couple moved into a Moscow apartment block reserved for the intelligence elite. A first child, Vasili, was born in 1932. The Gordievskys thrived under Stalin.<br><br> When Comrade Stalin announced that the revolution was facing a lethal threat from within, Anton Gordievsky stood ready to help remove the traitors. The Great Purge of 1936 to 1938 saw the wholesale liquidation of &#x201c;enemies of the state&#x201d;: suspected fifth columnists and hidden Trotskyists, terrorists and saboteurs, counterrevolutionary spies, Party and government officials, peasants, Jews, teachers, generals, members of the intelligentsia, Poles, Red Army soldiers, and many more. Most were entirely innocent. In Stalin&#x2019;s paranoid police state, the safest way to ensure survival was to denounce someone else. &#x201c;Better that ten innocent people should suffer than one spy get away,&#x201d; said Nikolai Yezhov, chief of the NKVD. &#x201c;When you chop wood, chips fly.&#x201d; The informers whispered, the torturers and executioners set to work, and the Siberian gulags swelled to bursting. But as in every revolution, the enforcers themselves inevitably became suspect. The NKVD began to investigate and purge itself. At the height of the bloodletting, the Gordievskys&#x201d; apartment block was raided more than a dozen times in a six-month period. The arrests came at night: the man of the family was led away first, and then the rest.<br><br> It seems probable that some of these enemies of the state were identified by Anton Gordievsky. &#x201c;The NKVD is always right,&#x201d; he said: a conclusion both wholly sensible, and entirely wrong.<br><br> A second son, Oleg Antonyevich Gordievsky, was born on October 10, 1938, just as the Great Terror was winding down and war was looming. To friends and neighbors, the Gordievskys appeared to be ideal Soviet citizens, ideologically pure, loyal to Party and state, and now the parents to two strapping boys. A daughter, Marina, was born seven years after Oleg. The Gordievskys were well fed, privileged, and secure.<br><br> But on closer examination there were fissures in the family fa�ade, and layers of deception beneath the surface. Anton Gordievsky never spoke about what he had done during the famines, the purges, and the terror. The older Gordievsky was a prime example of the species Homo Sovieticus, an obedient state servant forged by Communist repression. But underneath he was fearful, horrified, and perhaps gnawed by guilt. Oleg later came to see his father as &#x201c;a frightened man.&#x201d;<br><br> Olga Gordievsky, Oleg&#x2019;s mother, was made of less tractable material. She never joined the Party, and she did not believe that the NKVD was infallible. Her father had been dispossessed of his watermill by the Communists; her brother sent to the eastern Siberian gulag for criticizing collective agriculture; she had seen many friends dragged from their homes and marched away in the night. With a peasant&#x2019;s ingrained common sense, she understood the caprice and vindictiveness of state terror, but kept her mouth shut.<br><br> Oleg and Vasili, separated in age by six years, grew up in wartime. One of Gordievsky&#x2019;s earliest memories was of watching lines of bedraggled German prisoners being paraded through the streets of Moscow, &#x201c;trapped, guarded, and led like animals.&#x201d; Anton was frequently absent for long periods, lecturing the troops on Party ideology.<br><br> Oleg Gordievsky dutifully learned the tenets of Communist orthodoxy: he attended School 130, where he showed an early aptitude for history and languages; he learned about the heroes of Communism, at home and abroad. Despite the thick veil of disinformation surrounding the West, foreign countries fascinated him. At the age of six, he began reading British Ally, a propaganda sheet put out in Russian by the British embassy to encourage Anglo-Russian understanding. He studied German. As expected of all teenagers, he joined Komsomol, the Communist Youth League.<br><br> His father brought home three official newspapers and spouted the Communist propaganda they contained. The NKVD morphed into the KGB, and Anton Gordievsky obediently followed. Oleg&#x2019;s mother exuded a quiet resistance that only occasionally revealed itself in waspish, half-whispered asides. Religious worship was illegal under Communism, and the boys were raised as atheists, but their maternal grandmother had Vasili secretly baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church, and would have christened Oleg too had their horrified father not found out and intervened.<br><br> Oleg Gordievsky grew up in a tight-knit, loving family suffused with duplicity. Anton Gordievsky venerated the Party and proclaimed himself a fearless upholder of communism, but inside was a small and terrified man who had witnessed terrible events. Olga Gordievsky, the ideal KGB wife, nursed a secret disdain for the system. Oleg&#x2019;s grandmother secretly worshipped an illegal, outlawed God. None of the adults in the family revealed what they really felt&#x2014;to one another, or anyone else. Amid the stifling conformity of Stalin&#x2019;s Russia, it was possible to believe differently in secret but far too dangerous for honesty, even with members of your own family. From boyhood, Oleg saw that it was possible to live a double life, to love those around you while concealing your true inner self, to appear to be one person to the external world and quite another inside.<br><br> Oleg Gordievsky emerged from school with a silver medal, head of the Komsomol, a competent, intelligent, athletic, unquestioning, and unremarkable product of the Soviet system. But he had also learned to compartmentalize. In different ways, his father, mother, and grandmother were all people in disguise. The young Gordievsky grew up around secrets.<br><br> Stalin died in 1953. Three years later he was denounced, at the 20th Party Congress, by his successor, Nikita Khrushchev. Anton Gordievsky was staggered. The official condemnation of Stalin, his son believed, &#x201c;went a long way towards destroying the ideological and philosophical foundations of his life.&#x201d; He did not like the way Russia was changing. But his son did.<br><br> The &#x201c;Khrushchev Thaw&#x201d; was brief and restricted, but it was a period of genuine liberalization that saw the relaxation of censorship and the release of thousands of political prisoners. These were heady times to be young, Russian, and hopeful.<br><br> At the age of seventeen, Oleg enrolled at the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations. There, exhilarated by the new atmosphere, he engaged in earnest discussions with his peers about how to bring about &#x201c;socialism with a human face.&#x201d; He went too far. Some of his mother&#x2019;s nonconformity had seeped into him. One day, he wrote a speech, na�ve in its defense of freedom and democracy, concepts he barely understood. He recorded it in the language laboratory, and played it to some fellow students. They were appalled. &#x201c;You must destroy this at once, Oleg, and never mention these things again.&#x201d; Suddenly fearful, he wondered if one of his classmates had informed the authorities of his &#x201c;radical&#x201d; opinions. The KGB had spies inside the institute.<br><br> The limits of Khrushchev&#x2019;s reformism were brutally demonstrated in 1956 when the Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary to put down a nationwide uprising against Soviet rule. Despite the all-embracing Soviet censorship and propaganda, news of the crushed rebellion filtered back to Russia. &#x201c;All warmth disappeared,&#x201d; Oleg recalled of the ensuing clampdown. &#x201c;An icy wind set in.&#x201d;<br><br> The Institute of International Relations was the Soviet Union&#x2019;s most elite university, described by Henry Kissinger as &#x201c;the Harvard of Russia.&#x201d; Run by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was the premier training ground for diplomats, scientists, economists, politicians&#x2014;and spies. Gordievsky studied history, geography, economics, and international relations, all through the warping prism of Communist ideology. The institute provided instruction in fifty-six languages, more than any other university in the world. Language skills offered one clear pathway into the KGB and the foreign travel that he craved. Already fluent in German, he applied to study English, but the courses were oversubscribed. &#x201c;Learn Swedish,&#x201d; suggested his older brother, who had already joined the KGB. &#x201c;It is the doorway to the rest of Scandinavia.&#x201d; Gordievsky took his advice.<br><br> The institute library stocked some foreign newspapers and periodicals that, though heavily redacted, offered a glimpse of the wider world. These he began to read, discreetly, for showing overt interest in the West was itself grounds for suspicion. Sometimes at night he would secretly listen to the BBC World Service or the Voice of America, despite the radio-jamming system imposed by Soviet censors, and picked up &#x201c;the first faint scent of truth.&#x201d;<br><br> Like all human beings, in later life Gordievsky tended to see his past through the lens of experience, to imagine that he had always secretly harbored the seeds of insubordination, to believe his fate was somehow hardwired into his character. It was not. As a student, he was a keen Communist, anxious to serve the Soviet state in the KGB, like his father and brother. The Hungarian Uprising had caught his youthful imagination, but he was no revolutionary. &#x201c;I was still within the system but my feelings of disillusionment were growing.&#x201d; In this he was no different from many of his student contemporaries.<br><br> At the age of nineteen, Gordievsky took up cross-country running. Something about the solitary nature of the sport appealed to him, the rhythm of intense exertion over a long period, in private competition with himself, testing his own limits. Oleg could be gregarious, attractive to women, and flirtatious. His looks were bluntly handsome, with hair swept back from his forehead and open, rather soft features. In repose, his expression seemed stern, but when his eyes flashed with dark humor, his face lit up. In company he was often convivial and comradely, but there was something hard and hidden inside. He was not lonely, or a loner, but he was comfortable in his own company. He seldom revealed his feelings. Typically hungry for self-improvement, Oleg believed that cross-country running was &#x201c;character building.&#x201d; For hours he would run, through Moscow&#x2019;s streets and parks, alone with his thoughts.<br><br> One of the few students he grew close to was Stanislaw Kaplan, a fellow runner on the university track team. &#x201c;Standa&#x201d; Kaplan was Czechoslovakian, and had already obtained a degree from Charles University in Prague by the time he arrived at the institute as one of several hundred gifted students from the Soviet bloc. Like others from countries only recently subjugated to Communism, Kaplan&#x2019;s &#x201c;individuality had not been stifled,&#x201d; Gordievsky wrote, years later. A year older, he was studying to be a military translator. The two young men found they shared compatible ambitions and similar ideas. &#x201c;He was liberal-minded and held strongly sceptical views about communism,&#x201d; wrote Gordievsky, who found Kaplan&#x2019;s forthright opinions exciting, and slightly alarming. With his dark good looks, Standa was a magnet to women. The two students became firm friends, running together, chasing girls, and eating in a Czech restaurant off Gorky Park.<br><br> An equally important influence was his idolized older brother, Vasili, who was now training to become an &#x201c;illegal,&#x201d; one of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s vast global army of deep undercover agents.<br><br> The KGB ran two distinct species of spy in foreign countries. The first worked under formal cover, as a member of the Soviet diplomatic or consular staff, a cultural or military attach�, accredited journalist or trade representative. Diplomatic protection meant that these &#x201c;legal&#x201d; spies could not be prosecuted for espionage if their activities were uncovered, but only declared persona non grata, and expelled from the country. By contrast, an &#x201c;illegal&#x201d; spy (nelegal, in Russian) had no official status, usually traveled under a false name with fake papers, and simply blended invisibly into whatever country he or she was posted to. (In the West such spies are known as NOCs, standing for Non-Official Cover.) The KGB planted illegals all over the world, who posed as ordinary citizens, submerged and subversive. Like legal spies, they gathered information, recruited agents, and conducted various forms of espionage. Sometimes, as &#x201c;sleepers,&#x201d; they might remain hidden for long periods before being activated. These were also potential fifth colum...</p><h2>Fox &amp; Chick: The Party: and Other Stories (Learn to Read Books, Chapter Books, Story Books for Kids, Children's Book Series, Children's Friendship Books) (Fox &amp; Chick, 1)</h2><p><b>A 2019 Theodore Seuss Geisel Award Honoree<br><br>NPR Best Books of the Year, <i>New York Times</i> Notable Children's Book, <i>Boston Globe</i> Best Book of the Year </b><br><br><b>Join the dynamic, yet opposite duo as they learn to appreciate differences among friends:</b> Fox and Chick don't always agree, but Fox and Chick are always friends.

They call upon myth, memory, and language to delve into the poet&#x2019;s experience of house arrest, his encounters with Israeli interrogators, and the periods he spent in prison.

She is a consulting editor at <em>Tricycle</em>. Her work has appeared in numerous publications, including <em>Harper</em>'s, the <em>New Yorker, New Republic, Allure, Outside, Vogue, Tin House, Antioch Review,</em> and <em>Creative Nonfiction</em>. Tisdale is currently training as a priest at Dharma Rain Zen Center in Portland, Oregon.</p>Known for her books and essays but less well-known as a lay Buddhist teacher and consulting editor to the magazine <i>Tricycle</i>, Tisdale unites her spiritual and feminist concerns by breathing life into historical women of Buddhism. The book constructs a female lineage (line of teachers) for Zen Buddhism, including ancestors known through mythic tales and through Indian, Chinese and Japanese traditional writings. So much of women's history is unwritten that Tisdale "reimagines" the past in a series of stories about individual women who taught and practiced Buddhism. Some sketches are as beautifully done as brush paintings, apparently simple yet the result of skillful rendering of details selected to summon up an unknown and far removed life. Tisdale's descriptive writing is especially imaginative ("Their waters are endlessly broken by canoes and rough sailing boats, and endlessly renewed"). Occasionally, the book is confusing; the Western eye only slowly negotiates the Japanese names that can pile up in any given story of a woman and her family, teachers and temples. Although not a book for beginning students of Buddhism, this compilation of gracefully written stories helps American Buddhism put its egalitarian stamp on the evolving wisdom tradition that originated with the Indian prince Siddhartha 2,500 years ago. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nichols, Jr., offers a precise yet unusually readable translation of one of the great Platonic dialogues on rhetoric. </p><p>Featuring some of Plato's most soaringly lyrical passages, the Phaedrus investigates the soul's erotic longing and its relationship to the whole cosmos, as well as inquiring into the nature of rhetoric and the problem of writing.</p><p>Nichols's attention to dramatic detail brings this dialogue to life. Plato's striking variety in conversational address (names and various terms of relative warmth and coolness) is carefully reproduced, as is alteration in tone and implication even in the short responses. The translation renders references to the gods accurately and non-monotheistically for the first time, and includes a fascinating variety of oaths and invocations. Nichols believes that Plato's thought on rhetoric has been largely misunderstood, and he uses his translation as an opportunity to reconstruct the classical position on right relations between thought and public activity.</p></p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.James H.

Kelly&#x2019;s got a built-in group of fiber arts specialists, the Lambspun Knitters, who are working away on blankets and booties. As they sit around the table crafting their keepsakes, the story of Giselle Callahan is a popular topic of conversation.&nbsp;<br><br> Giselle is the young wife of Henry Callahan, a Fort Connor banking scion, who traded in his previous wife of forty years for a newer model. Giselle&#x2019;s prowess as a skilled country club golfer and social climber puts her on someone&#x2019;s hit list. When she is found dead on the greens at the golf club, Kelly and her Lambspun crew worry that a vicious killer is in their midst. They must work fast to bring an unhinged murderer to justice on the back nine before Kelly&#x2019;s very special delivery...<br><br> <b>DELICIOUS RECIPES AND KNITTING PATTERN INCLUDED!&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Maggie Sefton</b>&nbsp;is the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling Knitting Mysteries, including&nbsp;<i>Knit to Be Tied</i>,&nbsp;<i>Purl Up and Die</i>,&nbsp;<i>Yarn Over Murder</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Close Knit Killer</i>. She was born and raised in northern Virginia, where she received her bachelor&#x2019;s degree in English literature and journalism. Maggie has worked in several careers over the years, from a CPA to a real estate broker in the Rocky Mountain West. However, none of those endeavors could compare with the satisfaction and challenge of creating worlds on paper. She is the mother of four grown daughters, currently scattered around the globe, and resides in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado with two very demanding dogs.One<br><br> "Does that feel good?" Kelly Flynn asked her Rottweiler as she rubbed behind one of his silky black ears. "Does it, Carl?"<br><br> Carl, for his part, had already given Kelly an answer with his doggie sounds of pleasure. He bent his head slightly, the better for Kelly to rub behind the "special spot."<br><br> "Is that your favorite spot?" Kelly said to her dog as she stood beside him on her cottage's outside patio. Carl replied with a little crooning sound. Yes! Yes! That's it!<br><br> Kelly rubbed for a few more seconds. "Okay, that will have to be it for now, Carl. I have to leave."<br><br> Carl looked momentarily surprised when she stopped rubbing. Then he held his head in the way only dogs can do and trotted over to his water dish.<br><br> As Carl slurped several large gulps of water, Kelly caught sight of a pair of golfers strolling toward the green that was closest to the edge of the golf course. And the closest to Kelly's backyard.<br><br> "Looks like you'll have some golfers nearby, Carl," Kelly advised her dog as she slid open the glass patio door. "Try not to scare them to death."<br><br> Either Carl understood exactly what Kelly had said, or the golfers happened to edge into his peripheral vision at precisely that moment. Carl's head jerked up, and he let out a loud, "Woof!" He followed up with a string of sharp barks as he charged for the back fence. There, he stood up on his back legs, front paws on the chain link, and barked more threats to the unlucky twosome who dared to visit "his" course. The two golfers turned around at the sound of an authoritative Rottweiler bark. Then one waved toward Kelly before they both returned their concentration to their next golf shot.<br><br> Kelly waved back then glanced at the sunny Colorado sky above. It looked like they were really moving full steam into early summer. Springtime temps of the high seventies and now the low eighties were teasing everyone. April and May flowers were sprouting everywhere. She loved it.<br><br> Kelly walked over to the cottage kitchen counter and retrieved her medium-sized plastic mug. Ever since she'd reached the start of her ninth month of pregnancy, Kelly noticed that fast movements and turns had become harder to manage. Her round, bigger-than-a-basketball belly led the way.<br><br> At that moment, the baby inside gave a sturdy kick, and Kelly placed her hand over the spot. "Starting soccer practice already?" she teased the baby. "Okay, I'm going to settle into the armchair and attempt to get some work done, so try to keep the goals to a minimum."<br><br> Mug in one hand, Kelly retrieved her laptop and sat in the comfy old armchair that Jayleen had given her. "Every mom needs a comfy chair before the baby's born and a sturdy rocking chair after the baby's born," Jayleen had told her with a tone of authority.<br><br> Letting the armchair's comfortable embrace surround her, Kelly popped open her laptop. She wanted to add the last of this week's condo expenses she'd calculated for her real estate investor client Arthur Housemann. She'd entered two rows of expenditures onto the spreadsheet when several sturdy kicks from the baby made Kelly's belly bulge in one spot then another.<br><br> "Are you running down the field, Jack?" Kelly said as she watched what she'd come to recognize as a baby foot create another bulge. Kelly placed her hand over the spot. "Or was that a goal? If it was winter, I'd swear you were playing ice hockey," she laughed softly. Suddenly, that bulge disappeared and she felt more movement inside, then another bulge appeared on her left side. "Goal!" Kelly cheered then laughed.<br><br> Just then, her cell phone rang beside her elbow. Steve's name flashed on the phone screen.<br><br> "Hey there," Kelly said on answering. "He just scored a soccer goal."<br><br> Steve's laughter came over the phone. "Atta boy. Lots of kicks, huh?"<br><br> "Ooooooooh yeah," Kelly said, settling deeper into the armchair's embrace.<br><br> "How're you doing?" Steve asked.<br><br> "I'm doing fine, just trying to get some work done on Housemann's accounts, but Jack's running up and down the field and the laptop keeps jumping."<br><br> "You're exaggerating," Steve said after another short burst of laughter.<br><br> "No, I'm not," Kelly said, watching her belly move again. "This kid keeps kicking goals."<br><br> "Did you have a second cup of coffee or something?" Steve asked, in a slight tone of concern.<br><br> "No!" Kelly protested. "I'm being so good, I don't even recognize myself." She had to laugh. "One cup of half-strength black coffee a day, as Sheriff Megan decreed."<br><br> "Atta girl," Steve cheered. "Megan will be proud. We're all proud of you."<br><br> "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys aren't having to try to stay awake in the afternoons, either. I swear, I'm gonna drink two huge mugs of black coffee after Jack's born."<br><br> Steve laughed softly. "It won't be long now. At least I hope. I keep talking to guys who say their wives went past the ninth month."<br><br> "Bite your tongue," Kelly teased. "I swear, I think I'm big as a house, but all the moms at Lambspun keep telling me I'm not that huge. You wouldn't believe all the stories I hear."<br><br> "Yeah, I would. Guys are always telling me stories. I swear, Dutch has a huge family, and everything that happens to them is drama and trauma." Steve chuckled.<br><br> At the mention of Steve's longtime construction foreman, Kelly asked, "Is Dutch doing okay? He's still only working half days, I hope."<br><br> "Oh yeah. He keeps wanting to work longer, but I've laid down the law to him. It's only six months after his heart surgery, so he's still in the rehab period as far as I'm concerned. He hates it when I say that, but I've told the guys to grab his tools if necessary. Whatever it takes to get him to stop working."<br><br> "You know, some guys have to work. It's part of who they are," Kelly observed as she felt Baby Jack move about. "You and I have both heard stories about men who didn't live very long once they retired from their jobs. Their work is part of their identity, and it's like they don't know how to live without it. I really believe the reason that Burt has never had another heart attack is because he's had the chance to involve himself with the programs that help men who are recovering alcoholics."<br><br> Some stray memories suddenly popped into Kelly's head. "Oh, and don't forget, Burt regularly helped me whenever I was sleuthing around."<br><br> Steve gave a short laugh. "How can I forget that? Listen, I see Dutch signaling me. The guys just finished digging out that basement space. Gotta check it out."<br><br> "Sounds good. That must be the third or fourth basement they've dug on your new building site. How many town houses will be there?"<br><br> "No more than twelve. It's a small site, but it's an infill lot. The city doesn't have many of those, and they're prime spots. I'll talk to you later. Take it easy."<br><br> "Will do," Kelly said, then heard his phone click off. She returned to her accounting activities, methodically entering expenses and revenues. Baby Jack had quieted down, so this was a perfect time to get some work done. She drained her mug of unsweetened grapefruit juice, hoping that Afternoon Sleepiness wouldn't attack. But she could feel the combination of the comfy armchair and a warming spring afternoon was about to take its toll. What she wouldn't give for a cup of Eduardo's full-strength Black Gold right now.<br><br> House of Lambspun shop owner Mimi Parker looked up from stacking bundles of bubblegum pink yarn on the antique dry sink in the shop foyer. �Kelly! I was hoping you�d come in this afternoon,� she declared with a big smile as Kelly stepped inside the knitting shop. �I wanted to show you some of the adorable baby outfits two of the knitters in this morning�s group created.�<br><br> "Oh wow. Did they really make them for me?" Kelly said as she paused by one of the tables in the entryway. Several fat skeins of lime green fiber were stacked in a neat pile. She stroked one of the skeins. Soft. Cotton, maybe? Examining the label she read that it was one hundred percent cotton from India. Kelly was always surprised how good her fingers were at detecting different fibers just by stroking them. In the nearly ten years she'd been coming to Lambspun, Kelly had gone from someone who had never knitted anything in her life to what she referred to as an Intermediate Advanced knitter. The word "Expert" never felt comfortable to her mind.<br><br> "They're not for you," Mimi said with a grin as she walked over to Kelly. "They're for Baby Jack." She reached out and gave Kelly's tummy a soft pat. "How're you doing, Jack?"<br><br> "Oh, he was playing soccer earlier when I was trying to get some work done. Since it's springtime, I figured it was soccer."<br><br> "Were you racing around, Jack?" Mimi said with a little laugh. "You can't wait to get out, can you?"<br><br> "Well, since Jack's six pounds, the doctor says he could come in a couple of weeks or maybe he'll hang around longer. Who knows?" Kelly said as she walked toward the main knitting room.<br><br> Mimi followed after her. "Well, you're still carrying Jack a little high, so the baby hasn't dropped yet. You probably have a couple or more weeks to go."<br><br> Kelly smiled. "That term always makes me laugh. Dropped. It sounds so funny." She placed her fabric knitting bag on the long dark wood library table that dominated the main knitting room of the Lambspun shop. Kelly settled into one of the wooden chairs that bordered the table and glanced around the room.<br><br> Three sides of the room were lined with shelves. One entire wall contained open bins where yarns of every description spilled out. Since it was springtime, Mimi and the shop staff-the Lambspun elves, as Kelly called them-had filled the shelves with bright spring colors. Pink lemonade, lime green, lemon yellow, tangerine, blueberry. Cotton yarns, merino wool, alpaca, even bamboo. The yarn bins were stuffed to overflowing. Just like the central yarn room located between the foyer and the main room. Every wall there was stacked high with bulging shelves.<br><br> And both in the foyer and in the central yarn room hung beautiful handmade creations. Knitted, crocheted, and woven. Scarves, baby sweaters, cloche hats and berets, and socks both multicolored and patterned.<br><br> Mimi laughed lightly. "Yes, I always thought it was funny, too. But it's very apt. Suddenly, one morning you notice something is different. And when you look in the mirror, you see that your tummy is definitely lower." She pulled out a chair next to Kelly. "I'd be glad to get you a cup of strong black tea. Extra strong and black. Even strong tea still has less caffeine. You were able to enjoy that, I remember."<br><br> "Enjoy is an exaggeration," Kelly said, eyeing Mimi. "I choked it down."<br><br> "Okaaaaaay," Mimi said. "How about some milk?"<br><br> Kelly shook her head. "Not now. It'll make me sleepy. I usually have some in the evening."<br><br> "How about some almond milk or coconut milk instead?"<br><br> "Actually, those taste good, but they'll make me sleepy, too. Everything seems to make me sleepy nowadays." Kelly reached inside her fabric knitting bag and pulled out the fiber project she'd just started. A small baby hat made of azure blue and smoke gray yarns.<br><br> "Well, let me go get some of that new Yorkshire tea I bought yesterday. That's definitely stronger than most teas you find in the grocery stores, so maybe that will taste better." Mimi pushed back her chair.<br><br> "It doesn't have any strange ingredients, does it?" Kelly asked.<br><br> "No, no. Simply strong black tea. I'll make a half cup. That way you can give it a try," Mimi said as she walked away toward the caf&#x17d; that adjoined Lambspun knitting shop.<br><br> Kelly had long ago learned to give in to any of Mimi's suggestions. "Mother Mimi," as Kelly and her friends called the sixtyish shop owner, had become a second mother to Kelly and her closest friends, Jennifer, Megan, and Lisa. Mimi's only child had died in an awful accident many years ago. He was a freshman at the local Colorado State University and had gone up into the neighboring Poudre Canyon to a friend's house for a weekend party. Unfortunately, several of the other college students were taking drugs, and Mimi's son joined in. He had a very bad experience and wandered away from the house into the surrounding mountainous terrain. He fell to his death on a rocky ledge below.<br><br> Alone in the main knitting room, Kelly wasted no time in returning to her knitting project. She picked up her stitches where she left off with the baby hat. She wanted to have the hat finished before the baby came, and according to everyone, that could be anytime this month. A May baby, she thought, as her fingers went through the familiar knitting movements. A spring baby. With luck, maybe she could play a few softball games before their softball season ended in the fall.<br><br> That cheerful thought brought a smile as Kelly pictured herself slender again and running the bases under a sunny sky. The shop's entry doorbell tinkled while summer scenes filled her mind. Taking the baby out to the games like Megan and Marty did with their baby, Molly. Perfect.<br><br> "Hello, Kelly. How're you doing?" a familiar voice said behind her.<br><br> Kelly turned to see retired Fort Connor police detective Burt Parker walk into the room. "Hey, Burt. I'm doing fine. What have you been up to?"<br><br> Burt pulled out the chair beside Kelly. "Errands, as usual. Mimi had a list as long as my arm today, I swear." Burt chuckled.<br><br> Kelly smiled at her longtime mentor. Once he and shop owner Mimi had married a few years ago, Burt was at the shop every day. Kelly really enjoyed that, since she'd lost her own father to lung cancer many years earlier. "Face it, Burt. You love staying busy and doing those errands. Otherwise, I bet we'd see you here in the shop looking for stuff to do."<br><br> "You're right, Kelly. There're always things to do here." He leaned closer to Kelly's belly. "And how are you this afternoon, Baby Jack?"<br><br> "Oh, he's been having a great time playing soccer. I swear he scored several goals while I was trying to do my accounting earlier."<br><br> Burt chuckled. "Well, he's probably anxious to come on out and meet us all."<br><br> "Not until I finish his hat," Kelly teased, holding up the baby hat. There were only a few rows of blue and gray cotton yarn on the knitting needles.<br><br> "You've got another couple weeks or so, don't you?" Burt asked, with a concerned look.</p><h2>The Best American Mystery Stories 2017</h2><p><b>"Fans of such notables as C.J.

Jesus is not someone mysterious to him. Jesus is someone he recognizes, whose daily life is not unlike the life Lamsa himself had growing up. He grew up in a remote region of ancient lands where the customs, manners, and idioms, as well as the language of the Bible had been preserved throughout the centuries. He then wrote as one who had first hand knowledge and experience with the peoples, places, and traditions interwoven into the narrative of the Scriptural record. When Lamsa came to the Gospels and read about Jesus Christ, he understood him in ways that escape the average person simply because the Western reader is a foreigner to the land where Jesus lived. And through his eyes, the reader comes to know Jesus more intimately as well.</p><p>By virtue of his birth place, linguistic ability, and his scholarly achievements, George M. Lamsa was ideally suited to accomplish his outstanding contribution to the field of Biblical research. As all serious students of the Bible know, no one particular version of the Bible may accurately be called THE Word of God as originally given by God. In order to arrive at an accurate understanding of certain scriptural passages, one must at times examine various translations of the Bible, as well as the underlying original, ancient Biblical languages. Lamsa&#x2019;s pioneering work, including the notable Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts, provided invaluable resources for Biblical scholars and kindled a widespread interest in the long neglected, yet crucial, primary Aramaic texts. Dr. Lamsa dedicated his life to the work of translating the ancient texts into English and traveling the country to generate awareness and interest in Aramaic. Called by God, and encouraged by hundreds who heard him speak in churches, seminaries, and lecture halls; he labored for over 30 years to translate the entire Old and New Testaments. His first work in Aramaic translations, Four Gospels, was published in 1933; followed byNew Testament According to the Eastern Text in 1940. His culminating work, Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts in 1956, presented a translation of the Aramaic texts into easily understood modern English based upon the wording style of the King James Version. He also wrote several other books, including commentaries describing the customs and manners of early Christians.</p><h2>The Degrees of Knowledge (The Collected Works of Jacques Maritain, Vol. 7)</h2><p>The First American edition of a British best-seller<br><br>In <i>The Principle of Duty</i></p><p>Ralph McInerny (1929&#x2013;2010) was Michael P.

The man has entered our folklore.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p><b>Rex Stout</b> (1886&#x2013;1975) wrote dozens of short stories, novellas, and full-length mystery novels, most featuring his two indelible characters, the peerless detective Nero Wolfe and his handy sidekick, Archie Goodwin.1<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your name, please?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I asked her only as a matter of form. Having seen her picture in newspapers and magazines at least a dozen times, and having seen her in person at the Flamingo and other spots around town, I had of course recognized her through the one-way glass in the door as I went down the hall to answer the doorbell, though she wasn&#x2019;t prinked up for show. There was nothing dowdy about her brown tailored suit or fur stole or the hundred-dollar pancake on her head, but her round white face, too white there in daylight, which could be quite passable in a restaurant or theater lobby, could have stood some attention. It was actually flabby, and the rims of her eyes were red and swollen. She spoke.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think&nbsp;...&#x201d; She let it hang a moment, then said, &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re Archie Goodwin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I nodded. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re Althea Vail. Since you have no appointment, I&#x2019;ll have to tell Mr. Wolfe what you want to see him about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather tell him myself. It&#x2019;s very confidential and very urgent.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t insist. Getting around as I do, and hearing a lot of this and that, both true and false, I had a guess on what was probably biting her, and if that was it I would enjoy watching Wolfe&#x2019;s face as she spilled it, and hearing him turn her down. So I admitted her. The usual routine with a stranger who has no appointment is to leave him or her on the stoop while I go and tell Wolfe, but I can make exceptions, and it was a raw windy day for late April, so I took her to the front room, the first door on your left when you are inside, returned to the hall, and went to the second door on the left, to the office.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe was on his feet over by the big globe, glaring at a spot on it. When I had gone to answer the bell he had been glaring at Cuba, but he had shifted to Laos.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A woman,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> He stuck with Laos. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; I conceded. &#x201c;But she says it&#x2019;s urgent and confidential, and she could pay a six-figure fee without batting an eye. Her name is Althea Vail. Mrs. Jimmy Vail. You read newspapers thoroughly, so you must know that even the Times calls him Jimmy. Her eyes are red, presumably from crying, but she is now under control. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;ll blubber.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t leave her on the stoop because of the weather. She&#x2019;s in the front room. I have heard talk of her, and I understand that she is prompt pay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned. &#x201c;Confound it,&#x201d; he growled. He took in a bushel of air through his nose, let it out through his mouth, and moved. Behind his desk he stood, a living mountain, beside his oversized chair. He seldom rises to receive a caller, woman or man, but since he was already on his feet it would take no energy to be polite, so why not? I went and opened the connecting door to the front room, told Mrs. Vail to come, presented her, and convoyed her to the red leather chair near the end of Wolfe&#x2019;s desk. Sitting, she gave the stole a backward toss, and it would have slid to the floor if I hadn&#x2019;t caught it. Wolfe had lowered his 285 pounds into his chair and was scowling at her, his normal attitude to anyone, especially a woman, who had the gall to come uninvited to the old brownstone on West 35th Street, his house, expecting him to go to work.<br> &nbsp;<br> Althea Vail put her brown leather bag on the stand at her elbow. &#x201c;First,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better tell you how I got here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not material,&#x201d; Wolfe muttered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes it is,&#x201d; she declared. It came out hoarse, and she cleared her throat. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see why. But first of all it has to be understood that what I&#x2019;m going to tell you is absolutely in confidence. I know about you, I know your reputation, or I wouldn&#x2019;t be here, but it has to be definite that this is in complete confidence. Of course I&#x2019;m going to give you a check as a retainer, and perhaps I should do that before&nbsp;...&#x201d; She reached to the stand for her bag. &#x201c;Ten thousand dollars?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe grunted. &#x201c;If you know about me, madam, you should know that that&#x2019;s fatuous. If you want to hire me to do a job, what is it? If I take it, a retainer may or may not be required. As for confidence, nothing that you tell me will be revealed unless it involves a crime which I am obliged, as a citizen and a licensed private detective, to report to authority. I speak also for Mr. Goodwin, who is in my employ and who&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It does involve a crime. Kidnaping is a crime.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is indeed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But it must not be reported to authority.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My brows were up. Seated at my desk, my chair swiveled to face her, I crossed off the guess I had made. Apparently I wouldn&#x2019;t get to watch Wolfe&#x2019;s face while a woman asked him to tail her husband, or to hear him turn her down. He was speaking.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Certainly kidnaping is unique. The obligation not to withhold knowledge of a major crime must sometimes bow to other considerations, for instance saving a life. Is that your concern?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then you may trust our discretion. We make no firm commitment, but we are not fools. I suppose you have been warned to tell no one of your predicament?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Then I was wrong. How you got here is material. How did you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I phoned a friend of mine, Helen Blount, who lives in an apartment on Seventy-fifth Street, and arranged it with her. The main entrance to the apartment house is on Seventy-fifth Street, but the service entrance is on Seventy-fourth Street. I phoned her at half past ten. I told my chauffeur to have my car out front at half past eleven. At half past eleven I went out and got in my car and was driven to my friend&#x2019;s address. I didn&#x2019;t look behind to see if I was being followed because I was afraid the chauffeur would notice. I got out and went into the apartment house&#x2014;the men there know me&#x2014;and I went to the basement and through to the service entrance on Seventy-fourth Street, and Helen Blount was there in her car, and I got in, and she drove me here. So I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s the slightest chance that they know I&#x2019;m seeing Nero Wolfe. Do you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Wolfe turned to me. &#x201c;Archie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I nodded. &#x201c;Good enough. Hundred to one. But if someone&#x2019;s waiting in Seventy-fifth Street to see her home and she never shows, he&#x2019;ll wonder. It would be a good idea to go back before too long and enter on Seventy-fourth and leave on Seventy-fifth. I would advise it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her red-rimmed eyes were at me. &#x201c;Of course. What would be too long?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That depends on how patient and careful he is, and I don&#x2019;t know him.&#x201d; I glanced at my wrist. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s twenty-five after twelve. You got there a little more than half an hour ago. You could reasonably be expected to stay with your friend quite a while, hours maybe. But if he knows you well enough to know that your friend Helen Blount lives there he might call her number and ask for you and be told that you&#x2019;re not there and you haven&#x2019;t been there. I have never known a kidnaper personally, but from what I&#x2019;ve read and heard I&#x2019;ve got the impression they&#x2019;re very sensitive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She shook her head. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t be told that. Helen told her maid what to say. If anyone asks for me, or her either, he&#x2019;ll be told that we&#x2019;re busy and can&#x2019;t come to the phone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good for you. But there&#x2019;s Helen Blount. She knows you came to see Nero Wolfe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t know what for. That&#x2019;s all right, I can trust her. I know I can.&#x201d; Her eyes went back to Wolfe. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s how I got here. When I leave I have to go to my bank, and then I&#x2019;ll go back to Seventy-fourth Street.&#x201d; It was coming out hoarse again, and she cleared her throat and coughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my husband,&#x201d; she said. She got her bag and opened it and took out an envelope. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t come home Sunday night, and yesterday this came in the mail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her chair was too far away for her to hand it to Wolfe without getting up, and of course he wouldn&#x2019;t, so I did. It was an ordinary off-white envelope with a typewritten address to Mrs. Jimmy Vail, 994 Fifth Avenue, New York City, no zone number, and was postmarked BRYANT STA APR 23, 1961 11:30 P.M. Sunday, day before yesterday. The flap had been cut clean with a knife or opener, no jagged edges. I handed it to Wolfe, and after a glance at the address and postmark he removed the contents, a folded sheet of cheap bond paper, also off-white, five by eight unfolded, the kind you get in scratch pads. He held it to his left, so I could read it too. We no longer have it, but from some shots I took of it the next day I can have it reproduced for you to look at. It may tell you what it told Wolfe about the person who typed it. Here it is:<br> &nbsp;<br> We have got your Jimmy safe and sound. We haven&#x2019;t hurt him any and you can have him back all in one piece for $500,000 if you play it right and keep it strictly between you and us. We mean strictly. If you try any tricks you&#x2019;ll never see him again. You&#x2019;ll get a phone call from Mr. Knapp and don&#x2019;t miss it.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The HERO Effect - Revised Edition</h2><p>HEROES ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BE ORDINARY!

He engineered Australia's success at four Olympic Games and five Commonwealth Games and has coached 63 top swimmers in international competitions to 27 Olympic and World Championship medals. Now, through <i>Championship Swim Training</i>, he and coauthor John Atkinson, a former national team coach in Australia and current national youth coach with British Swimming, provide the detailed plans and strategies to help all swimmers maximize their swimming potential.</p><p>Beginning with Sweetenham's five golden rules for swimming that apply to all swimmers&#x2014;regardless of their background&#x2014;<i>Championship Swim Training</i> is divided into two parts. </p><p>Part I, Technique Drills and Sets, deals with training zones and benchmark sets so critical to effective training and goal setting. Also included is a series of drill progressions and checklists that can be applied to each stroke and the individual medley. These progressions will help pinpoint stroke deficiencies and improve stroke technique as well as sculling, starts, turns, finishes, and kick and pull training. The checklists give swimmers and coaches tips for training and competition. </p><p>Part II, Workouts and Programs, is full of information for coaches to plan the long-term development of juniors through masters swimmers. Sample training sets are provided and can be customized to suit the level of that swimmer or squad. Part II also covers the critical tapering phase to get swimmers ready for competition and provides detailed racing strategies. Dryland conditioning suggestions help swimmers train all year round, whether in or out of the water. And no world-class coaching book would be complete without a chapter on how to completely and objectively evaluate your training program. </p><p><i>Championship Swim Training</i> provides a complete roadmap for coaches and swimmers who want to follow a systematic and proven way to record-breaking times!</p></p><p><p><b>Bill Sweetenham</b> was the coaching force behind Australia's success at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. He was voted Australian Coach of the Year three times and has coached 63 swimmers in international competitions to 27 medals in four Olympics and seven World Championships. He spent more than 20 years coaching Australian swimmers to success before accepting the position of head coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (1991 to 1994). He then returned to Australia as the national youth coach to prepare up-and-coming swimmers for the 2000 Olympics. To date, he says he's most proud of placing nine swimmers on the 1989 Australian Pan Pacific Team who scored a 100% strike rate for improved heats to final performances and a 100% personal best strike rate. </p><p>Sweetenham was named Great Britain's national performance director in November 2000, a position he currently holds. The rebuilding of Great Britain's team didn't take long: They posted their best results since 1975 at the 2001 World Championships in Japan. </p><p>In addition to taking national teams to the height of international success, Sweetenham continues to lecture, publish, and conduct clinics all over the world. </p><p><b>John Atkinson</b> returned to his homeland and joined Sweetenham in Great Britain as the national youth coach with British Swimming in November 2000.

This report explores the causes and wide-ranging consequences of Truth Decay and proposes strategies for further action.</p><p>(The authors) suggest the public's mental bandwidth is being stressed by today's torrent of information from the internet, social media, cable television and talk radio, all of which might &#x2014; partly because the media's audience has difficulty sorting fact from opinions &#x2014; be subtracting from the public's stock of truth and trust. Their suggestions range from the anodyne (schools that teach critical reasoning; imagine that) to the appalling (&#x201c;public money to support long-form and investigative journalism&#x201d;). But their main purpose is, appropriately, to suggest research projects that will yield facts about the consequences of the new media and intellectual landscape. (George F. Will, The Washington Post)<br><br><p>A look at how a selective sorting of facts and evidence isn't just dishonest, but self-defeating to a society that has always worked best when reasoned debate and practical problem-solving thrive.</p><p></p> (Barack Obama, on what he&#x2019;s been reading recently, June 2016)<br><br><p>The report defines &#x201c;truth decay&#x201d; as a set of four related trends (of which fake news is only a little part) and offers lots of ideas for future research. It&#x2019;s focused on the United States, though &#x201c;there is evidence that this phenomenon is also occurring elsewhere, especially in Western Europe. One of the ways in which I find the RAND report most useful is that it highlights throughout where research is still needed &#x2014; what the big questions still are. The authors reviewed more than 250 articles and books that fit into the Truth Decay framework; you&#x2019;ll find all the buzziest studies and academics mentioned here. But, they say, there&#x2019;s still so much more we don&#x2019;t know. If you&#x2019;re looking for something to study, you&#x2019;ll find so many ideas here.</p><p></p> (Laura Owen, Nieman Journalism Lab)</p><h2>Job (The NIV Application Commentary)</h2><p><p>The title character of the book of Job suffers terribly, but we should not mistakenly think that this book is just about Job. It is about all of us, and ultimately about God.</p><p>Many have thought that the book simply restates the perennial questions that plague humankind in a world full of suffering. But often our questions are too limited, and we must learn to ask better questions so that we might find more significant answers. The book of Job answers our original questions obliquely, letting these answers prompt deeper questions, and leading us to discover the wealth that the book has to offer.</p><p>Most people assume that the book of Job deals with the question of why righteous people suffer. Instead, John Walton suggests that the book is about the nature of righteousness, not the nature of suffering. As we learn to deepen our questions, God will transform how we think about his work in the world and about our responses in times of suffering.</p></p><p><p>John H.

In her dream role, Gene Roddenberry beamed her aboard the Starship Enterprise as Yeoman Janice Rand in the original &#34;&#34;Star Trek&#34;&#34; series. But a terrifying sexual assault on the studio lot and her lifelong feelings of emptiness and isolation would soon combine to turn her starry dream into a nightmare.</p><p>I wrote THE LONGEST TREK for my fans, because they've been asking for this book for years. I wrote it for my two sons, because they have never before heard the full story of the things I did and the things I went through when they were young. And I wrote it for myself, because I needed to purge those events from my memory and my soul, and get them down on paper. <p>It has been a liberating, exciting adventure to tell my story, and to witness the response it has gotten from people around the country. During the writing of the book, I was worried that the fans would hate me because of some of the awful things I've done in my life, which I freely disclose in THE LONGEST TREK. But no! Everyone has been wonderful to me, showering me with love and support! To everyone I've talked to or heard from since the book came out, THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart! </p><p>After the manuscript was completed, the first person I wanted to show it to was my friend Leonard Nimoy--Star Trek's Mr. Spock--who literally saved my life in those terrible days after I was written out of Star Trek. I sent the book to him, then I fretted and wondered, What will Leonard think? What if he hates the book? I didn't have long to wait. </p><p>A couple days later, my phone rang. It was Leonard. Grace, he said, would you like to hear the foreword I've written for your book? Here, in part, is what he read to me: </p><p>I call her Amazing Grace.' She rejects that name and denies that she is amazing, but I insist, because she is. ... </p><p>If you think this is simply another book of Star Trek anecdotes and inside jokes, take a deep breath and plunge in. This is a Star Trek book which will transform people's lives. It will give insight into a human condition and guidance to many in need. </p><p>It is a blessing to all of us that she has put this life of hers to such generous use. </p><p>My thanks to Grace--always amazing. </p><p>I cried when I first heard those words from my dear friend, Leonard Nimoy. </p><p>The very first day of the book's release, I was a guest at a science fiction convention in Pasadena, and I signed a copy for Ann Lockhart, a beautiful young actress you'll remember from Battlestar Galactica and many other shows. The next morning, she came up to me and her face was alight, and she said, Grace, your story is so incredible, I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it! Your book kept me up all night! It has been one of the great blessings of my life to have heard that same comment from dozens more people in recent weeks. </p><p>When I called Harlan Ellison and told him I had written an entire chapter on my cookies and milk days with him, I think it scared him half to death! Oh, no! he groaned. What did you write about me?! But after I sent him a copy, he called back and said, Grace, you're terrific! Thank you for sharing your story with the world! </p><p>I go to Star Trek conventions and book signings around the country, and everywhere I go, people line up around the block to get a copy. In Detroit, Portland, New York, New Jersey, L.A., Las Vegas--everywhere I go, I take cartons of books and they sell out in a few hours! And when I'm out of books, I tell people, Check Amazon.com--they'll never run out of copies! </p><p>And after you read the book, please drop me a note in care of my publisher (the address is in the book), and tell me what you think! </p><p>With love, GRACE LEE WHITNEY</p>The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy by Grace Lee Whitney (ISBN: 1884956033) <p>I heard a male voice call, Grace Lee! Wait up! </p><p>I turned. It was The Executive. He was smiling and his face was a little flushed. He'd had a few drinks, just as I had. </p><p>I returned his smile. You want to walk me back to the party? I asked. </p><p>He waved his hand dismissively. The party's breaking up. I wanted to talk to you. I have some ideas for changes we could make in the show--changes that would affect you. I'd like to get your thoughts on those ideas before the next production meeting. </p><p>Oh? I was intrigued. What kind of changes? </p><p>I think Yeoman Janice Rand has been under-utilized. The character has been developing some interesting possibilities in the past few episodes. I have some ideas. Why don't we find a place to sit down and talk about it? </p><p>Well-- I hesitated for the briefest moment, a thrill of excitement at the thought that The Executive wanted to talk to me about my character. I was always looking for ways to advance my career, to enlarge my part and get more lines. He had reached the very thing that made me tick: my ambition. Where would you like to talk? I asked. </p><p>How about the E building? We can find an empty office over there. </p><p>I'd had a few drinks. My inhibitions were down and my judgment was impaired. Fine, I said. Let's go. </p><p>The sun was down, but it was still light outside as we walked out of the hangerlike sound stage. We crossed the driveway from the Gower Avenue entrance of Desilu Studios, and entered the office building. I don't remember exactly what we said as we walked--small talk, I think, about the show. We had nearly finished shooting the first dozen episodes of Star Trek, and the premiere broadcast was less than two weeks away. The excitement among the cast, creators and crew of the show was growing as our first airdate neared. We believed we had a hit on our hands, and the suspense of waiting for the audience response was exciting--and a little nerve-wracking. </p><p>The building was unlocked and we walked right in. The Executive put his arm on mine as we made our way down the darkened corridor. There were lights on in some of the offices, but the building was quiet, empty and mostly dark. There was no one in the building but The Executive, me, and possibly a janitor somewhere. The Executive opened a door, flipped on a light, and ushered me in. He indicated a chair for me. I was alone with him, but I didn't care. We were one big happy family on Star Trek, and I trusted him. </p><p>There was a stereo in the room. I settled into the chair he offered me, and he put on some soft music. The office had a private wet bar. He went and poured a couple of drinks, not bothering to ask if I wanted one. He knew I did. He handed me a glass, then sat down behind the desk. </p><p>We talked. And we laughed. And we drank. </p><p>He told me about upcoming scripts, and suggested story angles that could bring out a stronger relationship between Yeoman Rand and Captain Kirk. He put himself in Kirk's place, saying, Now I'm the Captain and you're the Yeoman. What would Rand say to Kirk in this situation? Put yourself into the role. Pour your heart out to me. And we did some very sexy role-playing--purely across the desk, about 10 feet apart. In my mind, we were simply improvising with the characters to explore the Kirk-Rand relationship for story possibilities. In his mind, I later realized, it was all part of a carefully laid strategy </p><p>You know, he said after we'd been talking a while, the thing that is so fascinating about Janice Rand is her repressed desire--her hunger for sex. </p><p>Not sex, I said. Love. She loves the Captain. </p><p>Same thing, said The Executive. She wants the Captain so badly but she represses it. She doesn't admit it--not even to herself. We all know what she really wants--but she herself doesn't know. She denies it. Janice Rand can't face her own desires, her own sexuality. </p><p>Absolutely, I agreed. That's the key to the character. </p><p>And you're just like Janice Rand. </p><p>I'm-- What? What did you say? I was vaguely aware that our discussion had just turned a sharp corner. But the buzz in my brain prevented me from grasping where The Executive was steering the conversation. </p><p>You're hungry inside, he said, just like Janice Rand. Hungry, needy, full of desire. But you repress it. You bottle it up. That's not healthy Grace. </p><p>There were no alarms going off, no warning bells. I just laughed, settled back, and smugly replied, I'm not bottling up anything. If there is anyone who is completely uninhibited, it's me. </p><p>Oh? he said lightly. Well, good, then. Let's see how uninhibited you are. Undress for me. </p><p>What?! I burst out laughing. You're kidding! </p><p>The Executive rose and came around the desk, towering over me. I'm not kidding, Grace. We both know what we want--if we're willing to be honest with each other. I'm being honest with you right now. I want you. I want to see you as you are, underneath ... all of that. With a gesture, he indicated my clothes, from my neck to my feet. I want you to undress for me, he repeated. </p><p>Then he unbuckled his belt and unbuttoned his shirt. Suddenly I knew he was completely serious. This man had a lot of power over my future, and he expected me to come across. If I didn't-- At that moment, I had a sinking feeling of horror, a sense of impending doom.</p></p><h2>Typewriter: The History � The Machines � The Writers</h2><p>Personal computers may have replaced the typewriter in most homes and offices, but the venerable writing machine is currently staging a comeback.

The people of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii fascinate Ayla. Their clothes, customs, artifacts, even their homes&#x2014;formed in great cliffs of vertical limestone&#x2014;are a source of wonder to her. And in the woman Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave (and the one who initiated Jondalar into the Gift of Pleasure), she meets a fellow healer with whom to share her knowledge and skills.<br><br>But as Ayla and Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, there are difficulties. Not all the Zelandonii are welcoming. Some fear Ayla&#x2019;s unfamiliar ways and abhor her relationship with those they call flatheads and she calls Clan. Some even oppose her mating with Jondalar, and make their displeasure known. Ayla has to call on all her skills, intelligence, knowledge, and instincts to find her way in this complicated society, to prepare for the birth of her child, and to decide whether she will accept new challenges and play a significant role in the destiny of the Zelandonii.<br><br>Jean Auel is at her very best in this superbly textured creation of a prehistoric society. <b>The Shelters of Stone</b> is a sweeping story of love and danger, with all the wonderful detail&#x2014;based on meticulous research&#x2014; that makes her novels unique. It is a triumphant continuation of the Earth&#x2019;s Children� saga that began with <b>The Clan of the Cave Bear</b>. And it includes an amazing rhythmic poem that describes the birth of Earth&#x2019;s Children and plays its own role in the narrative of <b>The Shelters of Stone</b>.</p><p>Jean Auel's fifth novel about Ayla, the Cro-Magnon cavewoman raised by Neanderthals, is the biggest comeback bestseller in Amazon.com history. In <i>The Shelters of Stone</i>, Ayla meets the Zelandonii tribe of Jondalar, the Cro-Magnon hunk she rescued from Baby, her pet lion. Ayla is pregnant. How will Jondalar's mom react? Or his bitchy jilted fianc�e? Ayla wows her future in-laws by striking fire from flint and taming a wild wolf. But most regard her Neanderthal adoptive Clan as subhuman "flatheads." Clan larynxes can't quite manage language, and Ayla must convince the Zelandonii that Clan sign language isn't just arm-flapping. Zelandonii and Clan are skirmishing, and those who interbreed are deemed "abominations." What would Jondalar's tribe think if they knew Ayla had to abandon her half-breed son in Clan country? The plot is slow to unfold, because Auel's first goal is to pack the tale with period Pleistocene detail, provocative speculation, and bits of romance, sex, tribal politics, soap opera, and homicidal wooly rhino-hunting adventure. It's an enveloping fact-based fantasy, a genre-crossing time trip to the Ice Age. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><b>Jean M. Auel</b> is an international phenomenon.

Its aftermath lives on to this day.<br></b><br>Nazism ascended by brute force and by cultural tyranny. Weimar Germany was a society in turmoil, and Hitler's rise was achieved not only by harnessing the military but also by restricting artistic expression. Hitler, an artist himself, promised the dejected citizens of postwar Germany a purified Reich, purged of "degenerate" influences.<br><br>When Hitler came to power in 1933, he removed so-called "degenerate" art from German society and promoted artists whom he considered the embodiment of the "Aryan ideal." Artists who had produced challenging and provocative work fled the country. Curators and art dealers organized their stock. Thousands of great artworks disappeared--and only a fraction of them were rediscovered after World War II.<br><br>In 2013, the German government confiscated roughly 1,300 works by Henri Matisse, George Grosz, Claude Monet, and other masters from the apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of one of Hitler's primary art dealers. For two years, the government kept the discovery a secret. In <i>Hitler's Last Hostages</i>, Mary M. Lane reveals the fate of those works and tells the definitive story of art in the Third Reich and Germany's ongoing struggle to right the wrongs of the past.<br></p><p><b>Mary M.

The sky above DC was a monochrome of gray cloud. A light rain fell, but a few drops of water were not going to bother him. Damp clothes? Whatever. Messed-up hair? He had no hair to ruin. That was long gone. Nothing had helped retain those once-magnificent curls. Not pills. Not potions. <i>Nada</i>.</p><p>He used a thumb and middle finger to snap open his Zippo lighter and lit the cigarette perched between his lips. Smoking was perhaps the only real pleasure he had.</p><p>He watched the downtown traffic and the pedestrians pass by, all miserable. Good. He didn&#x2019;t like anyone to be happy but himself. It wasn&#x2019;t pure selfishness. Joy was a zero sum game. There just wasn&#x2019;t enough to go around.</p><p>He sucked in a big lungful of smoke and held it in as he closed his eyes and tilted his face to the sky, exhaling as the sporadic raindrops exploded on his cheeks, forehead, and eyelids.</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re enjoying that.&#x201d;</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at the speaker. A young woman stood nearby, dressed in a long cream raincoat, hat, and brown leather gloves. She was pale and tall&#x2014;almost as tall as Beaumont, with wavy blond hair. Her lipstick was bright red. A bit too much for the office. A bit too suggestive. She must be new then. One of the many drones who serviced the company, he assumed. He had no doubt walked past her a hundred times or more by now. She would know his name, his job, and maybe even how he liked his coffee, but to Beaumont she was no one.</p><p>He shrugged and turned away. He was in no mood to chitchat, least of all with someone whose face he didn&#x2019;t need to recognize. She was a looker, sure; lots of real estate in the bust and hips, but he wanted to savor his damn cigarette alone, as God intended.</p><p>&#x201c;I used to smoke myself,&#x201d; the woman said, not taking the hint. It sounded like she was from the South. Probably some state Beaumont had been lucky enough never to soil his soles on.</p><p>&#x201c;That right?&#x201d; Beaumont felt obliged to say.</p><p>He edged away from her. It wasn&#x2019;t rude, he told himself. The young woman had intruded on his solitary time.</p><p>She did so again, stepping around Beaumont until they were face-to-face.</p><p>&#x201c;I smoked for maybe ten years,&#x201d; the young woman continued, undeterred. &#x201c;Two packs of Marlboro&#x2019;s a day. I had a cigarette in my hand all day long. I started young, you see. I managed to kick it, though. Now I&#x2019;ll allow myself the occasional cigar. Better than nothing, right? But oh, how I miss a real cigarette.&#x201d;</p><p>She was smiling, but in a sad way, and Beaumont began to feel sorry for her. She reminded him of his daughter.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re new, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;Is it that obvious?&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled in a manner that said the office coven had not welcomed her with open arms. He saw her loneliness and had a strange flash of the future, when he was an old man a couple of decades from now, fat and divorced with a daughter and a son who didn&#x2019;t bother to call him because he had never bothered to take them to the park. Would he be so in need of human contact that he would ignore a stranger&#x2019;s efforts to cold-shoulder him, because any interaction was better than none?</p><p>&#x201c;How are you settling in?&#x201d;</p><p>She wrinkled her nose and shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;That bad, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>&#x201c;Say,&#x201d; Beaumont began, &#x201c;would you like a smoke? For old times&#x2019; sake. It&#x2019;ll make you feel better.&#x201d;</p><p>He forced himself to smile.</p><p>The young woman&#x2019;s face lit up as if she&#x2019;d won the lottery and Beaumont felt even sadder for her. He rooted for the packet.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the woman said, holding up a palm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better not have one. I&#x2019;ll only start again. One&#x2019;s never enough, is it? But I wouldn&#x2019;t say no to a single drag, if you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>She gestured at Beaumont&#x2019;s precious cigarette. Beaumont looked at it too. He wasn&#x2019;t a sharing kind of guy, even if there was a hot chick half his age involved. He glanced up at the tall young woman. He looked at her bright red lips. She didn&#x2019;t appear to be sick. She didn&#x2019;t look like she was carrying some flesh-eating retrovirus. The hope in the woman&#x2019;s eyes tore down any resistance Beaumont had, and reminded him that he wasn&#x2019;t quite as soulless as he&#x2019;d thought.</p><p>There was no reason not to, but if a man was asking to share his cigarette, he would tell the fool to take a hike. But it wasn&#x2019;t a man asking.</p><p>Maybe if he let her put his cigarette between her lips, she would let him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>He offered the cigarette and the young woman took it between two fingers of her left hand. She brought it up and set it between her red lips with surgical precision, puckering around the filter and tensing them, but she did not inhale. Beaumont watched, entranced.</p><p>&#x201c;That was close,&#x201d; the young woman said, taking the cigarette away, but this time with her right hand. &#x201c;I almost caved.&#x201d;</p><p>Before handing the cigarette back, she rolled the filter between her gloved fingertips for a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Holding it was enough,&#x201d; the woman continued, as Beaumont watched.</p><p>&#x201c;Your choice,&#x201d; he said, taking the precious cigarette back.</p><p>A trace of lipstick was smeared on the filter. He took a drag.</p><p>The young woman watched him, something in her eyes. She removed the gloves and placed them into a pocket of her raincoat. She held out a palm to catch raindrops and when her fingers were wet wiped them across her lips several times. She took a handkerchief from a pocket and used it to wipe her lips clean.</p><p>&#x201c;Washing away the taste?&#x201d; Beaumont asked, a little aroused.</p><p>The woman smiled at him, but said nothing. She looked pleased with herself. Smug, even.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Beaumont began. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t answer. She just stared.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello? Anyone home?&#x201d; Beaumont waved a hand before her face and laughed.</p><p>No response. No wonder she was having a hard time fitting in when she was bat-shit crazy.</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said with a big exhale, erection retreating, and regretting allowing this weirdo to intrude into his private time. He felt the annoyance building inside him, anger making him feel hot despite the cool rain pattering on his scalp.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, honey. I&#x2019;ve humored you long enough. You can stop eyeballing me and be on your way. There&#x2019;s a good girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; the woman said, staring.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>Beaumont turned away, loosening his tie. Damn it, he was really fucking wound up now. His heart was hammering. He reminded himself never to feel sorry for anyone again. Ever. People were scum, always looking to take advantage.</p><p>He tried to swallow but his throat felt like sandpaper. This pissed him off even more. The smoke made him cough. Face red, he tossed the cigarette away. Was it sweat he felt on his forehead amongst the raindrops?</p><p>He turned to head back into the office, only to see the young woman still standing there.</p><p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you fucked off yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Soon,&#x201d; the woman said again.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen, you&#x2019;ve ruined my &#x2018;me time,&#x2019; so why don&#x2019;t you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Beaumont felt faint and reached out a hand to brace against the woman&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; the woman asked, without sympathy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve gone terribly pale.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Beaumont had no strength in his legs. If he wasn&#x2019;t standing straight up with his hand on the woman&#x2019;s shoulder, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to stay on his feet. His mouth filled with water.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; the young woman said. &#x201c;That can sometimes happen if one&#x2019;s constitution is weak. I think we can probably blame the cigarettes for that.&#x201d;</p><p>She stepped away from Beaumont and eased him down to his knees. Beaumont threw up. He watched vomit and blood sluice away in the rain.</p><p>&#x201c;What&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did you do to me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t claim all the credit, much as I would like to. My chemist is quite the genius, no?&#x201d;</p><p>Beaumont didn&#x2019;t answer. He toppled forward, face-first, into the pool of vomit and blood. His breathing was shallow, his pulse weak and irregular.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be on my way then,&#x201d; the young woman said. &#x201c;Adieu.&#x201d;</p><p>The last thing Beaumont saw was his extinguished cigarette, lying on the pavement, soaking up the rain.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>The tall woman walked away while Beaumont was taking his final breaths on the pavement. When she had passed beyond the wide-angle lens of the security camera overlooking the entranceway&#x2019;s exterior, she removed her cream overcoat, turned it inside out in a practiced move that took five seconds to complete, and slipped her arms into the fire-engine red coat it had become.</p><p>Half a block away her patent leather handbag was dumped into a rubbish bin. She dropped the blond wig into another bin at the end of the street.</p><p>Five efficient wipes with a solvent-soaked cotton pad removed the pale makeup from her face. The blue contacts came out next. The clip-on earrings followed. Pads from her bra joined them. As did ones from her hips. She stopped and lifted one foot to her ass. She reached down and twisted off the detachable four-inch heel from her shoe. She did the same with her other foot.</p><p>Less than a minute after Beaumont&#x2019;s heart had stopped, she boarded the 1115 bus to Arlington looking like a different person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>� Chapter 2 �</p><p>The sky above Prague was a patchwork of blue and white. Thin clouds paled the late-morning sun, but enough light fought through to shine from polished cars that lined the road and puddles that nestled along the curbs. The twisting, cobbled side street was crammed with boutiques and caf�s and town houses. Passersby were rare and traffic rarer still at this time of day.</p><p>A man sat alone at a small round metal table outside an artisan coffee shop. He was tall and wore a charcoal suit beneath a woolen overcoat, black, and black Oxford shoes. His dress shirt was white and his plain tie was burgundy. His black hair was longer than he often had it, at a few inches in length that brushed his ears and reached almost to his eyebrows if he did not push it back from his face. Two weeks without shaving had given him a dense beard that softened his jawline and disguised his cheekbones. The nonprescription glasses were plain and functional and further broke up the lines of his face to a shapeless, nondescript visage. His scarf was brown lamb&#x2019;s wool that was draped, but not tied, over his shoulders and tucked into the thigh-length overcoat, which was undone. He sipped a black Americano from a fine china cup that was as delicate as it was decorative. He made a conscious effort not to crush the little handle between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>His table was the central one of a line of three that lay on the pavement before the coffee shop, all painted white and chipped. The table to the left was occupied by two blond women in fine clothing and jewelry, probably mother and daughter, discussing the weather and where to have lunch after they finished their morning shopping trip. Large bags surrounded their chairs. To the man&#x2019;s right, two older men with lined faces and gray hair talked about how best to ingratiate themselves to their new younger, hipper clients.</p><p>The man in the suit would have preferred to sit on one of the flanking tables so as not to be boxed in with no obstacle-laden exit, but the two men and two women had been there before his arrival and both pairs seemed as if they would be staying long after he left. He pretended not to notice that the blonde mother kept glancing his way.</p><p>His hands and ears were red and his breath misted before him, but he kept the buttons of his overcoat unfastened and his scarf untied and elected not to wear gloves or a hat, as was common for him.</p><p>He wore no hat because, when removed, it meant a greater chance of casting DNA-rich hair follicles into the air to be left behind in his wake. He wore nothing on his hands as even the highest quality gloves reduced dexterity, which he valued above all else. It was more effective to grip with bare fingers, as it was to gouge eyes and tear out throats. His coat was unfastened so a weapon hidden beneath it or within an inside pocket could be drawn without interruption. He was unarmed, as was typical; carrying a weapon was only useful when he had no choice but to employ it, and was a threat to his liberty the rest of the time. But he was a man of habit: an unfastened coat had the added benefits of being easy to discard if required; the scarf was untied so as not to provide an enemy with a ready-made noose, but could be whipped away fast so as to be employed as such by himself against assailants.</p><p>He had many enemies, acquired over a professional life that ensured for every foe he managed to remove, a new one would be standing by to take their place. He had learned that survival depended on attention to detail, no matter how small or trivial it might seem before it proved decisive. He had learned to never lower his guard, no matter how safe he might be. Those lessons had been carved into his flesh, ensuring he never forgot them.</p><p>He was waiting. Waiting accounted for more than half his work. He was patient and focused. He had to be. He was a man who took his time and valued perfection over speed. He only rushed when necessary, which was rare. There was a certain artistry to his work that he found, if not enjoyable, then satisfying.</p><p>He sipped from the little cup. The quality of the coffee was excellent, but not in proportion to the effort it took to hold the delicate cup without breaking it. A shame, but the coffee provided a reasonable excuse for his presence.</p><p>On the far side of the road, a narrow-fronted hotel sat between town houses. A protruding awning and doorman were the only obvious signs of the hotel&#x2019;s existence. There were no fluttering flags or ostentatious trappings on display. The guests liked discretion and they liked privacy and were happy to pay the hotel&#x2019;s exaggerated rates to enjoy both.</p><p>The man in the suit was interested in one guest in particular. He was a member of the House of Sa&#x2019;ad, the extended royal family of Saudi Arabia. He was one of the many princes, a decadent thirty-year-old who spent his family&#x2019;s wealth almost as fast as it could be created. If he were not limited by his father, the prince would no doubt bankrupt them within eighteen months.</p><p>Al-Waleed bin Saud toured the world on a permanent holiday, moving from city to city with his humble retinue of sixteen individuals. That retinue included two personal assistants, an accountant, a chef, a security detail of nine and three young women who were listed as interns but did nothing except shop and spend time alone with the prince. He stayed in the most expensive hotels, and only ones that could accommodate his particular requirements. Though he lived an extravagant, hedonistic lifestyle he tried to maintain the image of a respectable, devout, and proud Saudi. To maintain the illusion and to ensure no word of his habits reached his homeland, he shied away from hotels that were too large or too rigid in rules and regulations. He elected to stay where he could bribe staff and hire out a whole floor at a time, whether he needed the rooms or not, for the sole use of his retinue. And he preferred to stay at hotels that could provide sui...</p></p><h2>Happy Ever After in Christmas</h2><p>It's beginning to look a lot like love . . .<br><br>As her thirtieth birthday approaches, deputy Jill Flaherty decides it's time to live a little.

But soon the Civil War erupts in the United States, and Ana finds her livelihood, and perhaps even her life, threatened by the very people on whose backs her wealth has been built: the hacienda&#x2019;s slaves, whose richly drawn stories unfold alongside her own in this epic novel of love, discovery and adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>Francisco Goldman Reviews <i>Conquistadora</i></strong> <p><b>Francisco Goldman is the author of <em>Say Her Name</em>, <em>The Art of Political Murder</em>, and <em>The Ordinary Seaman</em>.

It&#x2019;s a swashbuckling adventure, visceral and ardent; it&#x2019;s a historical novel so seamlessly told that you don&#x2019;t realize your heart&#x2019;s pounding even as your brain&#x2019;s amassing a wealth of fascinating new knowledge. This is a book that is like that one small island you&#x2019;ve been longing for since the great adventure and pirate stories of childhood. But the island is real, and this novel tells a real story--an important piece of history--that has never been told before. It&#x2019;s a story about Puerto Rico, Esmeralda Santiago&#x2019;s birthplace, and it shows us the island in a way that we&#x2019;ve never seen before.</p> <p>Here also is a portrait of characters I came to know and to care about, far from the usual New World stock cast of rapacious and greedy Spanish plantation owners chasing after slave and Creole girls. I was especially intrigued from the start by Ana, whom we first meet as a teenager in a convent in Seville in 1826, bent over the yellowing pages of some journals. (I have an established proclivity for historical novels that begin in convents!) Ana&#x2019;s story, as every feisty convent girl&#x2019;s life story should, begins and ends with rebellion: those journals belong to an ancestor of hers who journeyed to Puerto Rico with Ponce de Leon, and when Ana travels there just after her eighteenth birthday, she is a se�orita de buena familia rebelling against expectations--of her class, her gender, and the time period. By 1865, she&#x2019;s rich: a wealthy plantation owner on the island. She&#x2019;s lost none of her fire. But when the slaves on whom her sugarcane business was built catch the winds of change when Lincoln is elected in the US, she may lose it all. In the decades in between, Ana loves and loses, and finds her true home and her destiny. Puerto Rico, like many tropical &#x201c;paradises,&#x201d; turns out to be not the fantasy she&#x2019;d dreamed on, but a harsh land with harsh realities--a place that rewards only the toughest. The surprising Ana is an irresistible heroine despite the history she carries. She is a woman of her time, for good or ill. A woman who by the end of this sweeping story, comes to define her life not just by all that she has conquered but also all that she has lost. Most importantly, she lives in the reader&#x2019;s imagination.</p> <p><i>Conquistadora</i> is a novel that surpassed my every expectation.

I loved it." --Helen Macdonald, author of </b><b><i>H Is for Hawk</i></b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>�</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Beautifully written and timely." --Robert Macfarlane, author of </b><b><i>Underland</i></b><br><br>Helen Jukes is entering her thirties and feeling disconnected and trapped by her office job, when the book opens. She is struggling to settle into a new life in her recently purchased house in Oxford with its own small yard. As she ponders her new neighborhood and the many possibilities of a garden, she is brought back to a time in London when she accompanied a friend--a beekeeper--on his hive visits. And then, for good luck, she is given a colony of honeybees. According to folklore, a colony, freely given, brings good fortune, and the author embarks on an emotional, rewarding journey during the course of a year as she cares for these wondrous beings and learns the art of beekeeping. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jukes writes about what it means to "keep" wild creatures . . . on how to live alongside beings whose laws and logics are so different from our own . . . She delves into the history of beekeeping, and writes about discovering the ancient, complex, sometimes disturbing relationship between keeper and bee, human and wild thing. <br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Honeybee Heart Has Five Openings</i> is a story of observation, of the irrepressible wildness of these fascinating creatures so necessary to life on planet Earth, of the ways they seem to evade our categories, each time we attempt to define them. Are they wild, or domestic? Individual, or collective? Is honey an animal product, or plant-based? As the author's colony grows, and the questions that, at first, compel her interest begin to fade away, we see that the in-betweenness, the unsettledness, of honeybees calls out to a different kind of questioning; a different kind of consideration.</p><p><b>HELEN JUKES </b>was born in London, England.

This practical, hands-on guide explains why and how people habitually fall into this trap and provides a program, easily incorporated into everyday life, that frees them from this destructive behavior. Using a simple mandala, the book illustrates the four places humans go when they feel threatened, uncomfortable, or aren&#x2019;t fully centered or grounded in the present moment. Like a trail of pebbles left behind on a hike, it helps trace the path back to the authentic self. Drawing on his three decades of teaching consciousness, Richard Moss plays the role of wise shepherd, accompanying and encouraging the reader on a journey toward the genius within and away from fear and other limitations. Most importantly, he offers an always-available compass that directs readers back to the true self, and into the magic of the present moment.</p><p>"Richard Moss is one of the most important teachers of transformational knowledge."<br> -- <b>Marianne Williamson</b>, author of <i>A Return to Love</i> and <i>The Gift of Change</i> <br><br> "In this very elegant book, Dr. Richard Moss offers practical suggestions and techniques to find that presence within you that allows you to know yourself as a limitless awareness. I have admired Dr. Moss's work for many years and highly recommend The Mandala of Being."<br> -- <b>Deepak Chopra</b>, author of <i>Life After Death</i> <br><br> "<i>The Mandala of Being</i> reminds us that inherent in being human are the forces that distract who we really are from the calm of who we can be. Richard Moss's formula for coming back to the present is a process we can all achieve."<br> -- <b>Anthony Robbins</b> <br><br> "This is an important, deeply powerful, and simply magnificent book. What can be awakened, seen, and experienced here can save your true life and the life of our planetary family. I highly recommend reading it, now."<br> -- <b>Brooke Medicine Eagle</b>, author of <i>Buffalo Woman Come Singing</i> and <i>The Last Ghost Dance</i> <br><br> "So often we come home from a workshop or conference feeling at one with ourselves and the universe only to have it dissipate as soon as we have to decide who takes out the garbage. Moss gives us a way out. He's looked deeply into how we can maintain 'radical aliveness' in daily life. You will find many practical insights and innovative suggestions to help you. We highly recommend this book."<br> -- <b>Justine and Michael Toms</b>, cofounders of New Dimensions Media and New Dimensions Radio and authors of <i>True Work: Doing What You Love and Loving What You Do</i> <br><br> "Once again, Richard Moss has written a groundbreaking work of inspiration and depth. Having used Richard's teachings and books in my classes for many years, I know of the power of his wise insights into the essential nature of being. As one of the leading spiritual teachers combining spirituality and psychology, Richard has brought forth a deep teaching of the process of self-inquiry into the ever-present Now where 'I am sufficient as I am.' His book <i>The Mandala of Being</i> is truly an essential contribution to the important work of living a life in spiritual fullness."<br> -- <b>Ray Greenleaf, MA</b>, chair of counseling psychology, School of Holistic Studies, John F. Kennedy University<i>Starred Review.</i> For more than 100 years, Eastern insights about the quest for peace possible in the present moment have filtered into the West. Just so, Moss chooses the perfect visual map for this important book about self-awareness: a mandala. A mandala is a geometric, usually circular figure in Hindu and Buddhist thought that represents the universe. In the psychoanalytic realm, this figure represents the quest for self-unity and completeness. Using the mandala, Moss elegantly and with great elucidation and precision offers a place for modern seekers to stand centered in the now amid the four directions of past and future, you and me. His volume presents much clear thought about a potentially complicated topic. Readers who enjoyed Eckhart Tolle's <i>The Power of Now</i> and are ready to take the next step should gravitate easily to Moss's probing marriage of psychology, the transcendent nature of self, fear, faith and love. The fruits of Moss's many workshop experiences and exercises are cited throughout so as to make this potentially dense subject surprisingly accessible. A charity of spirit and extension to all religious traditions percolates through this volume. Concluding thoughts on the present climate of politically and culturally generated terror make this an especially potent offering. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Choosing twelve botanical specimens that correspond to twelve significant philosophers, he recasts the development of philosophy through the evolution of human and plant relations. A philosophical history for the postmetaphysical age, The Philosopher's Plant reclaims the organic heritage of human thought. With the help of vegetal images, examples, and metaphors, the book clears a path through philosophy's tangled roots and dense undergrowth, opening up the discipline to all readers.</p><p>Michael Marder (PhD, Philosophy, the New School) is IKERBASQUE Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of the Basque Country. He is the author of, among other books, Groundless Existence: The Political Ontology of Carl Schmitt (Continuum, 2012), The Event of the Thing: Derrida&#x2019;s Post-Deconstructive Realism (Toronto, 2013), Plant-Thinking: A Philosophy of Vegetal Life (Columbia, 2013), The Philosopher's Plant: An Intellectual Herbarium (Columbia, 2014), Energy Dreams (Columbia, 2017), and, with Luce Irigaray, Through Vegetal Being: Two Philosophical Perspectives (Columbia, 2016).From the conversation of Socrates and Phaedrus in the shade of the plane tree to Irigaray's meditation on the water lily, <i>The Philosopher's Plant</i> takes us outside city walls, across gardens of letters and vegetables, grassy slopes and vineyards, to the dimly lit sources of philosophy's vitality. With distinctive depth and clarity, Marder reminds us that, far from walled in, the human community communes with nature and is itself inhabited by nature. (Claudia Baracchi, Universit� degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca)<br><br><i>The Philosopher's Plant </i>is an original contribution to a concept which for too long has been marginalized. As the only contemporary philosopher working on plants from a deconstructive and weak-thought perspective, Marder provides not only another contribution to the philosophical concept of plants in general, but also adds onto his own work. (Santiago Zabala, ICREA/University of Barcelona)<br><br><i>The Philosopher's Plant</i> is a genuine pleasure to read and one of the most innovative books I have encountered in some time. Marder's argument is that contemporary scientific research into how plants communicate, interact with, and possibly even perceive the environment should be enriched by an engagement with how the Western philosophical tradition has already thought and continues thinking the problem of plant life for human being-in-the-world. (William Egginton, Johns Hopkins University)<br><br><i>The Philosopher's Plant</i> is an alluring immersion in phytophilia, exploring the thought of philosophers from Plato to Irigaray by way of their intimate reflections on plant life. Not only do we learn much that is subtle and profound about plants but we come to see the work of these thinkers in refreshing new lights. Humor and wit alternate with penetrating philosophical insight in this bouquet of delights. (Edward S. Casey, SUNY at Stony Brook, author of <i>The World at a Glance and The World on Edge</i>)<br><br>One must give Michael Marder credit for combining the deconstruction of our traditional metaphysics with a focus on the plant world. He invites us to perceive and consider again the presence and the potential of our living environment, the thoughtless use of which has damaged both our life and our culture.

Elizabeth Blackmar and Roy Rosenzweig tell the story of Central Park's people&#x2015;the merchants and landowners who launched the project; the immigrant and African-American residents who were displaced by the park; the politicians, gentlemen, and artists who disputed its design and operation; the German gardeners, Irish laborers, and Yankee engineers who built it; and the generations of New Yorkers for whom Central Park was their only backyard. In tracing the park's history, Blackmar and Rosenzweig give us the history of New York, and bring to life larger issues about the meaning of the word "public" in a democratic society.</p></p><p>In this superb and handsomely illustrated book - the first full-scale history of the park ever published - Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar tell the dramatic story of the creation of Central Park, of the people who built it and have used it. The book chronicles the launching of the park project, the disputes surrounding its design and management, the job of constructing it, and the various ways it has served generations of New Yorkers. Throughout, the authors delineate the politicians, business people, artists, immigrant laborers, and city dwellers who are the key players in the tale. In tracing the park&#39;s history, the writers also give us the history of New York. They explain how squabbles over politics, taxes, and real estate development shaped the park and describe the acrimonious debates over what a public park should look like, what facilities it should offer, and how it should accommodate the often incompatible expectations of different groups of parkgoers. The authors have uncovered surprising information about the immigrants and African Americans who were displaced from the park site, and they offer a critical reassessment of the famous collaboration of the park&#39;s designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. In rich detail, they describe working-class New Yorkers fighting for Sunday park concerts and against the practice of renting park seats for a nickel. They look back at the origins of the zoo and museums at the park&#39;s borders. They follow the battle between the twentieth-century reformers who wanted to introduce playgrounds and ball fields and the preservationists trying to protect the original Olmsted and Vaux design, and they explain the dramatic changes broughtabout by the social impulses of the New Deal and by Robert Moses. Rounding out the story, the authors take in the park&#39;s recent history: rising fears of crime in the 1950s, the &#34;be-ins&#34; and anti-war demonstrations of the 1960s, the devastating fiscal crisis of the 1970s, and the restoration of the park in the 1980s by the Central Park Conservancy. But the authors&#39; aim is much wider: they also show that conflicting visions of how a park should be managed and used raise larger issues about the meaning of the &#34;public&#34; in a democratic society. Who is the public? How can people take part in making decisions about public institutions? How do we create public space where people of diverse social and cultural backgrounds will feel welcome? These are questions that communities across the nation will continue to debate. Parkgoers and city dwellers everywhere will be enthusiastic readers of The Park and the People, as will those interested in urban, architectural, social, and cultural history, urban planning, and landscape architecture.<p>The late Roy Rosenzweig, Professor of History at George Mason University was the author of Eight Hours for What We Will: Workers and Leisure in an Industrial City, 1870-1920.

The Nordic Secret explores how Denmark, Norway and Sweden went from poor feudal agricultural societies to rich industrialized democracies thanks to the German educational concept of Bildung. The book also investigates the close relationship between Bildung and contemporary developmental psychology, i.e. the concepts of &#34;ego-development&#34; and &#34;transformative learning&#34;. The Nordic Secret concludes with a discussion about what we can learn from this positive transformation and how to apply it in the current global crises.</p><p>Lene Rachel Andersen (b. 1968) is Danish; she has a BA in business economy and studied theology 1993-97.

(<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>'Unlike many books written in homage to Austen, this is not a modern retelling of any of her stories, but rather a romp among contemporary Austen fanatics.

(<i>RT Book Reviews, 4 stars</i>)<br><br>'Reay has written so many Austen-tangential novels, they almost make a genre. While three adapt Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma, The Austen Escape stands alone . . . What's interesting about Reay is the way she tests how far from canon new stories can get. Where Flynn's Jane Austen Project gave us time travel; Reay offers an Austen-triggered psychotic break. Such storylines reveal something Janites already know: Austen is infinitely adaptable.'

His time at the club has led to Ferguson being regarded as one of the most successful, admired and respected managers in the history of the game. On May 8, 2013, Ferguson announced his retirement as manager of Manchester United. During his 27 years at the club, he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier Leagues and two UEFA Champions League titles. <br> <br><strong>Sir Michael Moritz</strong> is a venture capitalist and chairman of Sequoia Capital, the original backers of Apple, Cisco, YouTube and WhatsApp; he has also served on the board of directors of Google, LinkedIn, PayPal and Yahoo!. He is a former journalist with <em>Time Magazine</em> and author of the first history of <em>Apple</em>, <i>The Little Kingdom</i>. Originally from Wales, he lives near San Francisco, CA.LEADING is about leadership, management and the pursuit of success. It&#39;s a fantastic book, one of the best of its kind. The defining quality of Ferguson and Moritz&#39;s book is its clarity. The pair discuss leadership from a purely practical perspective, their raw material being Ferguson&#39;s vast experience. If there&#39;s one word, though, that characterises his philosophy of management it&#39;s discipline... And yet what comes through very strongly is humility, even vulnerability.Every success of his, you realise, has been hard-won. Failure has been a constant threat. Nagging anxiety he just accepted &#39;as part of my job&#39;. And he wouldn&#39;t have had it any other way. -- Marcus Berkmann Daily Mail For those interested in the subject of leadership, be it managing people effectively and getting the best out of them or learning which qualities and traits separate those who manage and those who inspire, Leading is a worthwhile read.Football fans might complain that the book is over too quickly, even though Ferguson provides 343 pages of entertaining stories and observations. Structuring his sermons in an easily read format is the latest managerial masterstroke from a man who made a career out of regularly producing them. Daily Express The foundation for its (Man Utd&#39;s) success was built by Ferguson, whose near-pathological obsession with football - and with winning - is a case study in leadership. -- Lionel Barber Financial Times Ferguson is one of the most successful men in his field - not just in football, but any sport in any era. He defied the norms and the scale of his accomplishments will only become more apparent with the passing of time. History will see that Ferguson grows, not diminishes. -- Matt Dickinson The Times This is as good as Ferguson&#39;s last book. Both are about being a particular kind of person...

As the consumption of legumes is a critical part of most every person&#39;s plan for healing, the need for a bean cookbook became evident. There are other bean cookbooks that have been published; however, the use of sugar, molasses, honey, or other sweeteners are prolific in those recipes. These are additions that Karen could not endorse because they do not add but rather subtract from a person&#39;s health. At the request of her clients and in light of the need for a cookbook that gave innovative recipes that were unquestionably healthy, she began the process of creating a cookbook. Over 300 recipes have been created to bring you and your family great health by the eating of beans, one of our richest sources of soluble fiber. Appetizers, soups, salads, main dishes, snacks, hummus and spreads, side dishes, and bean breads are all a part of this excellent work. With confidence the reader of this recipe book will be able to make delicious food that is 100% good for them-no need to weed out questionable ingredients. The recipes are easy to follow and easy to make.</p><p></p><h2>Batman: Detective Comics Vol. 5: Gothtopia (The New 52)</h2><p>Gotham City is and always has been a crime-free utopia, where the heroes are celebrated through the streets of one of America's best cities.

Legendary geologist J Harlen Bretz, starting in the 1920s, was the first to explore the area. Bretz, a former science teacher at Franklin High School in Seattle and then a professor at the University of Washington and later the University of Chicago, eventually formed the theory that the land was scoured in a virtual instant by a massive flood. His original thinking was rewarded with various forms of public and academic humiliation. In the mid-twentieth century, his theory sounded a bit too much like the biblical flood, and the scientific world wanting nothing to do with that sort of idea. (Ironically, Bretz was an avowed atheist, so this was hardly his inspiration.) Bretz&#39;s Flood tells the dramatic story of this scientific maverick-how he came to study the region, his radical theory that a huge flood created it, and how the mainstream geologic community campaigned to derail him from pursuing an idea that satellite photos would confirm decades later.</p><p>John Soennichsen is the author of <i>Live! From Death Valley</i>. He has written more than 250 articles, essays, and short fiction pieces for a variety of regional and national magazines and newspapers. <br><br>John's bachelor's degree in journalism is from the University of Oregon and his master of fine arts in creative writing is from Eastern Washington University. He lives with his family on a five-acre ranch just outside the Eastern Washington town of Cheney.J Harlen Bretz was an unusual geologist: more than a maverick-turned-icon, more than a conscientious and thorough field worker, and more than a demanding professor, he also had a remarkable sense of humor and the strength to persevere despite professional obloquy. Author Soennichsen (Live! From Death Valley) delivers a vivid portrait of the man whose pioneering work began by accident, when a 1921 summer field trip to the Cascade Mountains fell through. Instead, Bretz led his students on foot through the Washington Scablands around Spokane, and returned every summer after with his students and family to map, measure, and record the unique terrain-including the gigantic "ship" of eroded basalt at Grand Coulee and the dried remains of the world's largest waterfall. Bretz's conclusions, of a massive flood unlike anything ever observed, met with intense opposition (largely from those who never observed the Scablands in person). Only over time, and with the advent of aerial photography, were Bretz's ideas confirmed; it's now known that glacial Lake Missoula drained dozens of times, each time unleashing a vast flood across the Pacific Northwest. Soennichsen's book explores a fascinating life in science, and should have appeal for Pacific Northwesterners and science buffs. 20 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Anyone who reads poetry has reason to rejoice at living in the age when Seamus Heaney is writing."</p></p><p>The title of Seamus Heaney&#39;s first collection of poetry since winning the Nobel Prize in 1995 is the term used in Ireland for a carpenter&#39;s level, an earthy physical allusion to matters of spirit that is quintessential Heaney. And indeed this volume deals masterfully with the finding of a level balancing point in ethical, moral, and spiritual affairs. Heaney has famously likened his craft to the farming activities of his childhood, comparing his pen to his father&#39;s spade; here he extends that analogy, comparing the lines of a poem to furrows being plowed in the earth, and &#34;the poem as ploughshare that turns time/ Up and over.&#34; Heaney&#39;s furrows are straight and clean, his loamy lines abundantly fertile.<p><b>Seamus Heaney</b> received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995.</p></p><h2>Lonely Planet South Pacific (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p><i>#1 best-selling guide to the South Pacific</i><i>*</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet South Pacific</i></b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

It is a strange and beautiful novel, set in a near future where a sixteen-year-old Dominican girl, not all that unlike Adana herself, searches for a golden eternal city believed to exist somewhere on a parallel Earth. Lost City earns a modest but enthusiastic readership, and Adana begins a sequel. Then she falls gravely ill. Just before she dies, she and her son, Maxwell, destroy the only copy of the manuscript.<br><br>Decades later in Chicago, Saul Drower is cleaning out his dead grandfather&#x2019;s home when he discovers a mysterious package containing a manuscript titled <em>A Model Earth</em>, written by none other than Adana Moreau.<br><br>Who was Adana Moreau? How did Saul&#x2019;s grandfather, a Jewish immigrant born on a steamship to parents fleeing the aftershocks of the Russian Revolution, come across this unpublished, lost manuscript? Where is Adana Moreau&#x2019;s mysterious son, Maxwell, a theoretical physicist, and why did Saul&#x2019;s grandfather send him the manuscript as his final act in life? With the help of his friend Javier, Saul tracks down an address for Maxwell in New Orleans, which is caught at that moment in the grip of Hurricane Katrina. Unable to reach Maxwell, Saul and Javier head south through the heartland of America toward that storm-ravaged city in search of answers.<br><br>Blending the high-stakes mystery of <em>The Shadow of the Wind</em>, the science fiction echoes of <em>Exit West</em>, and the lyrical signatures of Bola�o and M�rquez, Michael Zapata&#x2019;s debut shines a breathtaking new light on the experiences of displacement and exile that define our nation. <em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau</em> is a brilliantly layered masterpiece that announces the arrival of a bold new literary talent.</p><p>"Zapata is a thrilling new talent. Alternating between the quest for a man in post-Katrina New Orleans for whom a mystery manuscript was left to be posthumously delivered, and the tale the manuscript itself tells, <em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau</em> is an ambitious novel that probes for friendship, the possibility of parallel worlds, and the way the real and the unreal meet at every moment."&#x2014;<strong>Ingrid Rojas Contreras, author of <em>Fruit of the Drunken Tree</em></strong><br>"This bold, inventive debut moves through the twentieth century like a cyclone. <em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau&nbsp;</em>opens with American Marines in Santo Domingo, tears on through New Orleans and reaches a roaring end in the Atacama Desert of Chile. Michael Zapata writes as skillfully of rebellion as he does of joy and every page of <em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau&nbsp;</em>comes alive."&#x2014;<strong>Idra Novey, author of <em>Ways to Disappear </em>and <em>Those Who Knew</em></strong><br>"Spellbinding and sage, <em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau</em>&nbsp;is a beautifully imagined saga. Adana Moreau's long lost novel unites a fascinating cast of characters with a hypnotic pull, weaving together their lives and transcending time. Michael Zapata steers us on a journey through history, friendship, family, the extraordinary, the ordinary, and even the stars. The Lost Book of Adana Moreau is a rich and philosophically poignant homage to the metaphysical magic of storytelling.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Kira Jane Buxton, author of <em>Hollow Kingdom</em></strong><br><em>"The Lost Book of Adana Moreau</em> is a hypnotic, whirling meditation on displacement and exile. This is a novel that cherishes the bonds between people even when those bonds are seemingly severed by time and distance. Zapata is a brilliant new voice who controls impermanence, asymmetry, and possibility like a classical composer with perfect pitch."&#x2014;<strong>Maurice Ruffin, author of <em>We Cast a Shadow</em></strong><br>&#x201c;<em>The Lost Book of Adana Moreau</em> is a profound novel about the persistence of stories and the singular power that books can conjure. Zapata is a luminous writer&#x2014;a rule-breaker in the best way, and a storyteller who weaves between eras and genres with fluidity and grace. I loved every page of this bold debut.&#x201d;&#x2014;<strong>Matthew Sullivan, author of <em>Midnight at the Bright Ideas Bookstore</em></strong></p><h2>The Complete Poems and Translations (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The essential lyric works of the great Elizabethan playwright--newly revised and updated</b><br><br> Though best known for his plays--and for courting danger as a homosexual, a spy, and an outspoken atheist--Christopher Marlowe was also an accomplished and celebrated poet. This long-awaited updated and revised edition of his poems and translations contains his complete lyric works--from his translations of Ovidian elegies to his most famous poem, "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love," to the impressive epic mythological poem "Hero and Leander."<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>Christopher Marlowe</b> (1564-1593) was born in Canterbury the year of Shakespeare&#x2019;s birth. Like Shakespeare, he was of a prosperous middle-class family, but unlike Shakespeare he went to a university, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he received the bachelor&#x2019;s degree in 1584 and the master&#x2019;s degree in 1587. The terms of his scholarship implied that he was preparing for the clergy but he did not become a clergyman. Shortly before he received his M.A. the University seems to have wished to withhold it, apparently suspecting him of conversion to Roman Catholicism, but the Queen&#x2019;s Privy Council intervened on his behalf, stating that he &#x201c;had done her majesty good service&#x201d; and had been employed &#x201c;in matters touching the benefit of the country.&#x201d; His precise service is unknown. After Cambridge, Marlowe went to London, where he apparently lived a turbulent life (he had two brushes with the law and was said to be disreputable) while pursuing a career as a dramatist. He wrote seven plays--the dates of which are uncertain--before he was yet again in legal difficulties: he was arrested in 1593, accused of atheism. He was not imprisoned, and before his case could be decided he was dead, having been stabbed in a tavern while quarreling over the bill.</p><h2>Buddha Nature: The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra with Commentary</h2><p><b>The Buddha's definitive teachings on how we should understand the ground of enlightenment and the nature and qualities of buddhahood.</b><br><br>All sentient beings, without exception, have buddha nature&#x2014;the inherent purity and perfection of the mind, untouched by changing mental states. Thus there is neither any reason for conceit nor self-contempt. This is obscured by veils that are removable and do not touch the inherent purity and perfection of the nature of the mind. The <i>Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra</i>, one of the &#x201c;Five Treatises&#x201d; said to have been dictated to Asanga by the Bodhisattva Maitreya, presents the Buddha&#x2019;s definitive teachings on how we should understand this ground of enlightenment and clarifies the nature and qualities of buddhahood. This seminal text details with great clarity the view that forms the basis for Vajrayana, and especially Mahamudra, practice.</p><p>The doctrine of Buddha Nature is foundational to Buddhist philosophy. Every sentient being shares this nature, and because it is our essence and this essence is undefiled, we can remove the stains which prevent us from realizing our full potential. Buddha Nature clearly explains this doctrine.Jamg�n Kongtr�l Lodr� Thay� (1813&#x2013;1899), the profoundly learned and realized master who compiled what are known as the Five Great Treasures, wrote the outstanding commentary to The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra translated here. Called The Unassailable Lion&#x2019;s Roar, it presents Maitreya&#x2019;s text as a background for the Mahamudra teachings in a way that is especially clear and easy to understand.<br><br>Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche provided the annotations and the explanations on which the present translation is based.

This concern threw into relief the prevailing notion that&#x2014;such unusually competitive cases notwithstanding&#x2014;people, rather than parties, should and do control presidential nominations. But for the past several decades, <i>The Party Decides</i> shows, unelected insiders in both major parties have effectively selected candidates long before citizens reached the ballot box.<br> <br> Tracing the evolution of presidential nominations since the 1790s, this volume demonstrates how party insiders have sought since America&#x2019;s founding to control nominations as a means of getting what they want from government. Contrary to the common view that the party reforms of the 1970s gave voters more power, the authors contend that the most consequential contests remain the candidates&#x2019; fights for prominent endorsements and the support of various interest groups and state party leaders. These invisible primaries produce frontrunners long before most voters start paying attention, profoundly influencing final election outcomes and investing parties with far more nominating power than is generally recognized.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Marty Cohen</b> is assistant professor of political science at James Madison University. <b>David Karol</b> is assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. <b>Hans Noel</b> is assistant professor of government at Georgetown University. <b>John Zaller</b> is professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles.&#34;The Party Decides is an important book that will set a new standard for understanding the primary election process.

An acronym for The Celebrated Man In The Street, T.C. Mits is very much a product of his time, an early experiment in the personalized style of mass communication which has become the norm. Like many Americans who fought in the war, everyman Mits has a limited education and little knowledge of the world beyond his home; this book offers him a series of short lessons in mathematical logic and its social utility: "The value of Science and Mathematics is not limited to the gadgets which they give us, but is also in their philosophy." In each lesson, a mathematical example or proof is described, whimsically illustrated (occasionally in proper mathematical graphs), and then extended to non-mathematical matters; e.g., an amusing jaunt through Einsteinian relativity results in this "Moral": "Adapt yourself to a continually CHANGING world." The light-hearted lessons and corny line drawings are charming, to be sure, but numerous "Why We Fight" asides railing against Hitler and totalitarianism make it more than a little dated, and its condescending tone can grate; as described by Barry Mazer in the foreword, it's "funny" and "a bit exasperating," like "a loving, elderly aunt and uncle." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, the Court has subverted America's democratic institutions and wreaked havoc upon Americans' social and political lives.</p> <p>One of the first constitutional scholars to question the rise of judicial activism in modern times, Raoul Berger points out that "the Supreme Court is not empowered to rewrite the Constitution, that in its transformation of the Fourteenth Amendment it has demonstrably done so. Thereby the Justices, who are virtually unaccountable, irremovable, and irreversible, have taken over from the people control of their own destiny, an awesome exercise of power."</p> <p>The Court has accomplished this transformation by ignoring or actually distorting the original intent of both the framers and the supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment. In school desegregation and legislative reapportionment cases, for example, the Court manipulated the history, meaning, and purpose of the amendment's Equal Protection Clause in order to achieve a desired political result. In cases involving First Amendment freedoms and the rights of the accused, the judges converted the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause into a vehicle for the nationalization of the Bill of Rights. Yet these actions were nothing less than "usurpations" that robbed "from the States a power that unmistakably was left to them."</p> <p>This new second edition includes the original text of 1977 and extensive supplementary discourses in which the author assesses and rebuts the responses of his critics.</p> <p><b>Raoul Berger</b> retired in 1976 as Charles Warren Senior Fellow in American Legal History, Harvard University.</p></p><p>Raoul Berger was Charles Warren Senior Fellow in American Legal History at the Harvard Law School.

He is widely considered the most successful investor of the 20th century. Buffett is the primary shareholder, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and consistently ranked among the world's wealthiest people. He was ranked as the world's wealthiest person in 2008 and as the third wealthiest person in 2011. In 2012, American magazine Time named Buffett one of the most influential people in the world. Buffett is called the "Wizard of Omaha", "Oracle of Omaha", or the "Sage of Omaha" and is noted for his adherence to the value investing philosophy and for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth. Buffett is also a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Gates Foundation.When I started learning about Warren Buffett, one of the first things I did was buy a printer that could print on both sides of the page. I got a ream of three hole paper, and filled a few binders with Buffett's letters to investors, all of which are freely available on his website. . . . <p>Well, now they have been helpfully compiled by my friend Max Olson. This edition includes charts I haven't seen anywhere else, showing Berkshire's cost of float (to the uninitiated: Buffett has borrowed money more cheaply than the U.S. government over the years, and used this fuel to invest at incredible rates of return), a chronological list of acquisitions, and even includes a topic index. </p><p>Kudos to Olson and Buffett for making this public.

Many of us have asked that question. We want to pray. We intend to pray. But, as spiritual director and professor MaryKate Morse notes, "We don't pray as consistently or as meaningfully as we might like." And yet prayer offers us such spiritual riches. Prayer<ul><li>draws us to experience love and to be love</li><li>increases our faith</li><li>expands our vision of God</li><li>helps us grow in self-understanding</li><li>gives us perspective on life and death</li></ul> Morse continues: "Through prayer, we experience forgiveness, guidance and peace. We are healed physically and emotionally. We experience the mystery of God, see truth and receive spiritual gifts. We receive vision and courage for God's mission. Faith becomes more beautiful, more real." This guidebook is designed to move you from lamenting over prayerlessness to the joy of praying. Whether you are a beginner or a lifetime person of faith, you will find a treasure trove of riches here to guide you into a deeper experience of prayer. Each chapter explores a different angle of prayer with sections focusing on each of the persons of the Trinity&#x2015;Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And each chapter offers specific ways to pray both on your own, with a partner or in a group. Sprinkled throughout are reflections from the author's former students describing on their own experience with these practices.

Fido was rarely permitted in the house; instead, the backyard and the front porch were his domain. Of course, he was a loyal companion to his owners and a friendly playmate to his owners&#x2019; children. More often than not, the family dog was named King, Princess, Duke, Dutchess, Fido, or Rover.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, it is not uncommon for the family dog to be named Sam, Sarah, Chester, Tiffany, Bob, or Suzy. This humanization of the family dog&#x2019;s name reflects a major change in the way people view their canine companions. No longer merely animals, our pets are now beloved members of the family. In fact, today, more likely than not, these four-footed family members live inside the home and, in many cases, even sleep in the family bed!<br> &nbsp;<br> Because we have taken animals&#x2014;specifically, dogs&#x2014;into our human environment, we can no longer treat them as animals and expect them to respond like humans. Instead, we must learn to integrate them into our lives and help them become a part of our human life-style. With a little understanding and patience, we can live happily with our dogs and they can live happily with us.<br> &nbsp;<br> I firmly believe that your dog is a member of your family. If you keep that in mind, if you truly feel it, your dog will act like one. That&#x2019;s one of the basic premises of this book. It&#x2019;s the best way I know to get your dog to do what you want.<br> &nbsp;<br> Okay. Once you accept the premise, we&#x2019;ve got to decide exactly how to treat the new family member.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s really fairly simple&#x2014;and the rest of this book is devoted to telling you just this: If you treat your dog with love, if you treat your dog with respect, if you treat your dog as if he or she is an intelligent, thinking animal capable of making decisions, your dog will respond in positive, astonishing ways.<br> &nbsp;<br> But first you&#x2019;ve got to understand not only that a dog thinks, but how and why he or she thinks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then and only then will you be able to get your dog to do what you want.<br> &nbsp;<br> And you know what? By the time you reach that point, your dog is going to want to do the same things you want him or her to do. Not 100 percent of the time, of course. Nobody&#x2019;s perfect. Besides, if you want something that obeys your every command every single time, you don&#x2019;t want a dog&#x2014;you want a robot! So go get a copy of Popular Mechanics or Science Digest. But if your goal is to turn Fido into an intelligent and loving member of the family, read on.<br> &nbsp;<br> WHAT YOU PUT IN IS<br> WHAT YOU GET OUT<br> &nbsp;<br> As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, a dog is a product of what&#x2019;s put into him. Two factors determine the personality, intelligence, and overall disposition of our canine companions: breeding&#x2014;whether the parents were genetically well-suited to produce strong, healthy offspring (in the case of the randomly bred stray &#x201c;generic&#x201d; dog, whether the odds were in his favor), so that he was born physically sound, without inbreeding faults or any other genetic disorders&#x2014;and environment&#x2014;what the owner does or does not do with that dog. In other words, you play a tremendous role in influencing your dog&#x2019;s personality, intelligence, and disposition!<br> &nbsp;<br> A DOG&#x2019;S SELF-IMAGE<br> &nbsp;<br> Dogs, just like people, have a strange way of living up&#x2014;or down&#x2014;to the image you project for them. Give them high expectations concerning their own abilities, and they&#x2019;ll reach for the stars trying to achieve them and please you. Downgrade their abilities by constantly telling them how displeased you are with their behavior, and you&#x2019;ll rip apart their self-esteem, making it impossible for them to believe in you and, most of all, in themselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fido needs a good self-image if he&#x2019;s to attain the goals you set for him. I&#x2019;m obviously not talking about graduating summa cum laude from Harvard or becoming the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, but I am talking about Fido attaining certain goals of good behavior&#x2014;being socially well adjusted and blending well into your family unit, while also maintaining his own identity and psychological well-being. We take this for granted when everything is right with Fido. It&#x2019;s the sort of thing you don&#x2019;t think about until it&#x2019;s not there.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s easy to tamper with how Fido feels about himself. There are three common ways. The first is a sin of omission&#x2014;it often takes place without you even realizing it.<br> &nbsp;<br> RIPPING APART FIDO&#x2019;S SELF-IMAGE&#x2014;WHAT NOT TO DO #1<br> &nbsp;<br> By doing nothing, by ignoring your pet, by not interacting with him on a regular basis, you can do great damage. It is simply not enough just to feed and walk your dog, then treat him like a piece of furniture the rest of the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, I know you lead busy lives and your time may be very limited, but dogs have a real need to have their egos stroked, to be told they&#x2019;re good, to understand how much they&#x2019;re loved. They need image- and confidence-building as much as we do. And they need a certain amount of self-esteem in order to behave well. They need to develop inner strength if they are to try something new or to learn to trust in you.<br> &nbsp;<br> RIPPING APART FIDO&#x2019;S SELF-IMAGE&#x2014;WHAT NOT TO DO #2<br> &nbsp;<br> Bad-mouthing Fido and spreading gossip about him is the second way you can rip apart Fido&#x2019;s self-esteem and destroy his self-confidence, thereby creating psychological problems where they never before existed. Dogs are very astute and can sense a lot of what&#x2019;s going on around them. Many are so clever that they can even tell when you&#x2019;re speaking of them in unflattering terms to other people. They&#x2019;ll hang their heads in shame and drop their tails between their legs while you discuss their mistakes with the neighbors. I&#x2019;ve often said, if you can&#x2019;t say something nice about your dog, don&#x2019;t say anything at all. Believe me, they know! Some dogs get embarrassed. Watch their faces and you&#x2019;ll see exactly what they&#x2019;re picking up. They know what&#x2019;s going on!<br> &nbsp;<br> I once had a client who did nothing but complain about his dog. &#x201c;Darn dog hair all over the place, darn walks on the coldest mornings of the winter, darn hard-to-open cans of dog food, darn this, darn that, darn dog.&#x201d; It was a bad situation, to say the least. The client was stressed out, with a lot of problems&#x2014;trouble on the job, trouble with his ex-wife, trouble paying child support. Although I could certainly sympathize with him, I&#x2019;ve never felt compassionate toward people who take out their problems on their pets, even though too many owners do exactly that.<br> &nbsp;<br> This dog was so used to being scolded and verbally abused that every time she saw her owner coming, her behavior, due to sheer fear, took a turn for the worse. Pepper didn&#x2019;t mean to knock over the Parsons table and everything on it as she scrambled out of the way, but she couldn&#x2019;t help trying to escape as fast as possible when she saw her owner. Then Pepper piddled on the living room rug out of sheer nervousness. Later that evening after waking from her nap, she also didn&#x2019;t mean to stay, frozen with fear, in her owner&#x2019;s favorite easy chair. Pepper knew he wanted to sit in it, but her frightened, sleepy brain couldn&#x2019;t figure out what to do except sit there and growl as he tried to swat her out of the chair. That&#x2019;s when I was called in.<br> &nbsp;<br> You see, what happened was that these two had set up a Catch-22. My client&#x2019;s berating behavior triggered Pepper&#x2019;s incorrect conduct, and her poor responses caused my client to react in an even worse fashion. His growing dislike of Pepper was crystal clear to her, and the ongoing battle actually affected her psychological balance. This was compounded by the fact that both Pepper and her owner had recently experienced the emotional upheaval of the divorce. Pepper in particular missed her human Mom and brothers and sisters. She became increasingly skittish and unhappy. The more they went at it, the more out of control things became. Pepper became so accustomed to hearing &#x201c;bad dog, stupid dog, darn dog!&#x201d; that she believed it. Everything she did seemed wrong, so as a result she did nothing right. The owner kept yelling and Pepper became submissive, then defensive, then slowly aggressive as she could take no more.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was Pepper a bad dog? No, but she was caught up in a bad situation. I am a firm believer that stress can be transmitted from one end of the leash to the other. Yes, Pepper&#x2019;s owner was stressed out, but the fact remained that no one was nurturing Pepper or helping her develop a good self-image. Was Pepper in fact a good dog, a pretty dog, a nice dog? Yes she was&#x2014;but nobody bothered to tell her so.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Library of Luminaries: Coco Chanel: An Illustrated Biography</h2><p>Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel's signature style and revolutionary approach to design changed women's fashion forever.

On the one hand, it provides a completely original and profound analysis of the most pressing personal and economic issue of the days ahead&#x2014;how the gargantuan changes wrought by technology and globalization are going to impact the way we live and work and imagine our world. Then, Dan Pink provides an equally original and profound and practical guidebook for survival&#x2014;and joy&#x2014;in this topsy-turvy environment. I was moved and disturbed and exhilarated all at once. A few years ago, Peter Drucker wondered whether the modern economy would ever find its Copernicus.

It&#x2019;s a pleasant and surprisingly entertaining little trip as he explores the workings of the brain, celebrates the proliferation and democratization of Target&#x2019;s designer products, and learns to draw and play games, all as a means of illustrating ways we can think and live in a better, more meaningful and productive manner. What surprised me about this book is how Pink realized that to empower individuals, it&#x2019;s necessary to really understand and act upon the powerful socioeconomic forces that shape the world economy. Unlike many of the recent xenophobic screeds that rail against the evils of outsourcing, Pink has figured out several paths that individuals and society can pursue that play to our strengths. So if Pink is correct, we&#x2019;re almost there. All it may take is for individuals and institutions to recognize this reality by using the tools we already possess.

The author of this well-researched and delightfully well-written treatise delivers that assertion after transporting the reader through a consciousness-awakening examination of how the information age, characterized predominantly by L-Directed (left brain) Thinking is being superseded by an age of high concept and touch, which brings R-Directed (right brain) Thinking more into play. The L-Directed Thinking is particularly in evidence in the guidance he provides to readers in what to read, where to go, and what to do to learn how to more fully engage their right hemispheres.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Fort Worth Star-Telegram</p> <p>&#x201c;Will give you a new way to look at your work, your talent, your future.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2014;Worthwhile</p> <p>&#x201c;Read this book.

But the keys to the kingdom are changing hands. The future belongs to a very different kind of person with a very different kind of mind&#x2014;creators and empathizers, pattern recognizers, and meaning makers. These people&#x2014;artists, inventors, designers, storytellers, caregivers, consolers, big picture thinkers&#x2014;will now reap society&#x2019;s richest rewards and share its greatest joys.</p> <p>This book describes a seismic&#x2014;though as yet undetected&#x2014;shift now under way in much of the advanced world. We are moving from an economy and a society built on the logical, linear, computerlike capabilities of the Information Age to an economy and a society built on the inventive, empathic, big-picture capabilities of what&#x2019;s rising in its place, the Conceptual Age. A Whole New Mind is for anyone who wants to survive and thrive in this emerging world&#x2014;people uneasy in their careers or dissatisfied with their lives, entrepreneurs and business leaders eager to stay ahead of the next wave, parents who want to equip their children for the future, and the legions of emotionally astute and creatively adroit people whose distinctive abilities the Information Age has often overlooked and undervalued.</p> <p>In this book, you will learn the six essential aptitudes&#x2014;what I call &#x201c;the six senses&#x201d;&#x2014;on which professional success and personal satisfaction increasingly will depend. Design. Story. Symphony. Empathy. Play. Meaning. These are fundamentally human abilities that everyone can master&#x2014;and helping you do that is my goal.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> A CHANGE of such magnitude is complex. But the argument at the heart of this book is simple. For nearly a century, Western society in general, and American society in particular, has been dominated by a form of thinking and an approach to life that is narrowly reductive and deeply analytical. Ours has been the age of the &#x201c;knowledge worker,&#x201d; the well-educated manipulator of information and deployer of expertise. But that is changing. Thanks to an array of forces&#x2014;material abundance that is deepening our nonmaterial yearnings, globalization that is shipping white-collar work overseas, and powerful technologies that are eliminating certain kinds of work altogether&#x2014;we are entering a new age. It is an age animated by a different form of thinking and a new approach to life&#x2014;one that prizes aptitudes that I call &#x201c;high concept&#x201d; and &#x201c;high touch.&#x201d;1 High concept involves the capacity to detect patterns and opportunities, to create artistic and emotional beauty, to craft a satisfying narrative, and to combine seemingly unrelated ideas into something new. High touch involves the ability to empathize with others, to understand the subtleties of human interaction, to find joy in one&#x2019;s self and to elicit it in others, and to stretch beyond the quotidian in pursuit of purpose and meaning.</p> <p>As it happens, there&#x2019;s something that encapsulates the change I&#x2019;m describing&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s right inside your head. Our brains are divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is sequential, logical, and analytical. The right hemisphere is nonlinear, intuitive, and holistic. These distinctions have often been caricatured. And, of course, we enlist both halves of our brains for even the simplest tasks. But the well-established differences between the two hemispheres of the brain yield a powerful metaphor for interpreting our present and guiding our future. Today, the defining skills of the previous era&#x2014;the &#x201c;left brain&#x201d; capabilities that powered the Information Age&#x2014;are necessary but no longer sufficient. And the capabilities we once disdained or thought frivolous&#x2014;the &#x201c;right-brain&#x201d; qualities of inventiveness, empathy, joyfulness, and meaning&#x2014;increasingly will determine who flourishes and who flounders. For individuals, families, and organizations, professional success and personal fulfillment now require a whole new mind.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> A FEW WORDS about the organization of this book. Perhaps not surprisingly, A Whole New Mind is itself high concept and high touch. Part One&#x2014;the Conceptual Age&#x2014;lays out the broad animating idea. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the key differences between our left and right hemispheres and explains why the structure of our brains offers such a powerful metaphor for the contours of our times. In Chapter 2, I make a resolutely hardheaded case, designed to appeal to the most left-brained among you, for why three huge social and economic forces&#x2014;Abundance, Asia, and Automation&#x2014;are nudging us into the Conceptual Age. Chapter 3 explains high concept and high touch and illustrates why people who master these abilities will set the tempo of modern life.</p> <p>Part Two&#x2014;the Six Senses&#x2014;is high touch. It covers the six essential abilities you&#x2019;ll need to make your way across this emerging landscape. Design. Story. Symphony. Empathy. Play. Meaning. I devote one chapter to each of these six senses, describing how it is being put to use in business and everyday life. Then, at the end of each of these chapters, marked off by shaded pages, is a Portfolio&#x2014;a collection of tools, exercises, and further reading culled from my research and travels that can help you surface and sharpen that sense.</p> <p>In the course of the nine chapters of this book, we&#x2019;ll cover a lot of ground. We&#x2019;ll visit a laughter club in Bombay, tour an inner-city American high school devoted to design, and learn how to detect an insincere smile anywhere in the world. But we need to start our journey in the brain itself&#x2014;to learn how it works before we learn how to work it. So the place to begin is the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, where I&#x2019;m strapped down, flat on my back, and stuffed inside a garage-size machine that is pulsing electromagnetic waves through my skull.</p> <p></p> <p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> PART ONE </p> <p> The Conceptual Age </p> <p></p> <p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> One </p> <p> RIGHT BRAIN RISING </p> <p></p> <p> </p><p> The first thing they do is attach electrodes to my fingers to see how much I sweat.

I lie down, the back of my head resting in the recessed portion of the stretcher. Over my face, they swing a cagelike mask similar to the one used to muzzle Hannibal Lecter. I squirm. Big mistake. A technician reaches for a roll of thick adhesive. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to need to tape your head down.&#x201d;</p> <p>Outside this gargantuan government building, a light May rain is falling. Inside&#x2014;smack in the center of a chilly room in the subbasement&#x2014;I&#x2019;m getting my brain scanned.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve lived with my brain for forty years now, but I&#x2019;ve never actually seen it. I&#x2019;ve looked at drawings and images of other people&#x2019;s brains. But I don&#x2019;t have a clue as to what my own brain looks like or how it works. Now&#x2019;s my chance.</p> <p>For a while now, I&#x2019;ve been wondering what direction our lives will take in these outsourced, automated, upside-down times&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve begun to suspect that the clues might be found in the way the brain is organized. So I&#x2019;ve volunteered to be part of the control group&#x2014;what researchers call &#x201c;healthy volunteers&#x201d;&#x2014;for a project at the National Institute of Mental Health, outside Washington, D.C. The study involves capturing images of brains at rest and at work, which means I&#x2019;ll soon get to see the organ that&#x2019;s been leading me around these past four decades&#x2014;and, in the process, perhaps gain a clearer view of how all of us will navigate the future.</p> <p>The stretcher I&#x2019;m on juts from the middle of a GE Signa 3T, one of the world&#x2019;s most advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines. This $2.5 million baby uses a powerful magnetic field to generate high-quality images of the inside of the human body. It&#x2019;s a huge piece of equipment, spanning nearly eight feet on each side and weighing more than 35,000 pounds.</p> <p>At the center of the machine is a circular opening, about two feet in diameter. The technicians slide my stretcher through the opening and into the hollowed-out core that forms the belly of this beast. With my arms pinned by my side and the ceiling about two inches above my nose, I feel like I&#x2019;ve been crammed into a torpedo tube and forgotten.</p> <p> TCHKK! TCHKK! TCHKK! goes the machine. TCHKK! TCHKK! TCHKK! It sounds and feels like I&#x2019;m wearing a helmet that somebody is tapping from the outside. Then I hear a vibrating ZZZHHHH! followed by silence, followed by another ZZZHHHH! and then more silence.</p> <p>After a half hour, they&#x2019;ve got a picture of my brain. To my slight dismay, it looks pretty much like every other brain I&#x2019;ve seen in textbooks. Running down the center is a thin vertical ridge that cleaves the brain into two seemingly equal sections. This feature is so prominent that it&#x2019;s the first thing a neurologist notes when he inspects the images of my oh-so-unexceptional brain. &#x201c;[The] cerebral hemispheres,&#x201d; he reports, &#x201c;are grossly symmetric.&#x201d; That is, the three-pound clump inside my skull, like the three-pound clump inside yours, is divided into two connected halves. One half is called the left hemisphere, the other the right hemisphere. The two halves look the same, but in form and function they are quite different, as the next phase of my stint as a neurological guinea pig was about to demonstrate.</p> <p>That initial brain scan was like sitting for a portrait. I reclined, my brain posed, and the machine painted the picture. While science can learn a great deal from these brain portraits, a newer technique&#x2014;called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#x2014;can capture pictures of the brain in action. Researchers ask subjects to do something inside the machine&#x2014;hum a tune, listen to a joke, solve a puzzle&#x2014;and then track the parts of the brain to which blood flows. What results is a picture of the brain spotted with colored blotches in the regions that were active&#x2014;a satellite weather map showing where the brain clouds were gathering. This technique is revolutionizing science and me...</p></p><h2>How to Think Like a Cat</h2><p><p><strong>Do cats worry about retirement? Nope. Do cats do things they don&#x2019;t want to do?

In talon-sharp prose she explores the spell the falcon has had over her and, by extension, all of us, whether we&#x2019;ve seen them &#x201c;through binoculars, framed on gallery walls, versified by poets, flown as hunting birds, through Manhattan windows, sewn on flags, stamped on badges, or winnowing through the clouds over abandoned arctic radar stations.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macdonald dives through centuries and careens around the globe to tell the story of the falcon as it has flown in the wild skies of the natural world and those of our imagination. Mixing history, myth, and legend, she explores the long history of the sport of falconry in many human cultures&#x2014;from Japan to Abu Dhabi to Oxford; she analyzes the falcon&#x2019;s talismanic power as a symbol in art, politics, and business; and she addresses the ways we have both endangered and protected it. Along the way we discover how falcons were mobilized in secret military projects; their links with espionage, the Third Reich, the Holy Roman Empire, and space programs; and how they have figured in countless stories of heroism and, of course, the erotic.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best of all, Macdonald has given us something fresh: a new introduction that draws on all her experience to even further invigorate her cherished subject. The result is a deeply informed book written with the same astonishing lyrical grace that has captivated readers and had everyone talking about this writer-cum-falconer.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Helen Macdonald </b>is a writer, poet, illustrator, historian, naturalist, and an affiliated research scholar of history and philosophy of science at the University of Cambridge. She is the author of the best-selling <i>H Is for Hawk</i>.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;This wonderful book explores how the fastest animals in history have carried the dreams of mankind on their wing. . . . Although Macdonald is passionate about birds of prey, and especially falcons, what makes this book so remarkable is not just that it is beautifully written but that it never loses sight of the big picture: the way these exquisite aerial predators&#x2014;the fastest animals that have ever lived&#x2014;have been used as constantly changing repositories for human meanings. . . . She weaves a memorable account of this most beguiling of creatures, from its earliest shamanistic uses to Marvel Comics&#x2019; first black superhero, the Falcon.

Sadhguru It s not just poetic license that allows us to refer to emotions as juicy . In a literal sense also, emotions are a chemical cocktail that course through our bodies. But while we have no problems with pleasant emotions, unpleasant emotions are the source of much angst in our lives. In Emotion: The Juice of Life, Sadhguru looks at the gamut of human emotions and how to turn them into stepping stones rather than stumbling blocks. Sadhguru is a yogi and profound mystic of our times. An absolute clarity of perception places him in a unique space in not only matters spiritual but in business, environmental and international affairs and opens a new door on all that he touches. Book 2: Relationships: Bond or Bondage If you enhance yourself into a very beautiful state, everyone will want to hold a relationship with you. Sadhguru Human beings constantly make and break relationships. Unfortunately, relationships can make and break human beings too. Why are relationships such a circus for most of us? What is this primal urge within us that demands a bond physical, mental, or emotional with another? And how do we keep this bond from turning into bondage? These are the fundamental questions that Relationships: Bond or Bondage looks at as Sadhguru shares with us the keys to forming lasting and joyful relationships, whether they are with husband or wife, family and friends, at work, or with the very existence itself.</p><p>Sadhguru is a yogi and profound mystic of our times.

Grace is a practicing family law attorney and lives in rural Maryland.<p><strong>One</strong></p> <p>"Why must all and sundry entertain themselves by telling me falsehoods?" </p> <p>Daniel Banks's teeth chattered as he put that conundrum to his horse, who had come to a halt, head down, sides heaving, before the only building in sight.</p> <p>"&#x2018;Ye can't miss it,'" Daniel quoted to himself. "&#x2018;The only lane that turns off to the left half a mile west of the village.'"</p> <p>This lowly dwelling was not Belle Maison, the family seat of the Earl of Bellefonte. Daniel had listened carefully to the directions given to him by the good folk at the Queen's Harebell. They'd sent him, in the middle of a roaring snowstorm, to a mean, weathered cottage, albeit one with a light in its single window.</p> <p>"I'll be but a moment," Daniel promised his gelding.</p> <p>Daniel's boots hit the snowy ground and agony shot up limbs too long exposed to the cold. He stood for a moment, waiting for the pain to fade, concocting silent epithets when he ought to have been murmuring the Twenty-Third Psalm.</p> <p>"Halloo, the house!" he called, thumping up three snowy steps. The porch sheltered a small hoard of split oak firewood. Somebody within burned that oak, for the frigid air held a comforting tang of wood smoke.</p> <p>The wind abated once Daniel ducked under the porch's overhang, while the cold was unrelenting. He longed for a fire, some victuals, and proper directions, though only the directions mattered.</p> <p>A man of God was supposed to welcome hardships, and Daniel did, mostly because his store of silent, colorful language was becoming impressive.</p> <p>He raised a gloved fist to knock on the door. "Halloo, the-!"</p> <p>The door opened, Daniel's sleeve was snatched into a tight grasp, and he was yanked into the warmth of the cottage so quickly he nearly bumped his head on the lintel.</p> <p>"I said I'd be home by dark," his captor muttered, "and full dark is yet another hour away. I was hoping this infernal snow would slow down." The young lady turned loose of Daniel's sleeve. "You're not George," she said.</p> <p>Alas for me. "The Reverend Daniel Banks, at your service, madam. I lost my way and need directions to Belle Maison, the Bellefonte estate. Apologies for intruding upon your afternoon."</p> <p>Though, might Daniel please intrude at least until his feet and ears thawed? Beelzebub was a substantial horse who grew a prodigious winter coat. He'd tolerate the elements well enough for a short time.</p> <p>While Daniel was cold, tired, famished, and viewing his upcoming visit to the earl's grand house as a penance at best.</p> <p>"Your gloves are frozen," the lady noted, tugging one of those gloves from Daniel's hand. "What could you be thinking, sir?" She went after his scarf next, unwinding it from his head, though she had to go up on her toes. She appropriated his second glove and shook the lot, sending pellets of ice in all directions.</p> <p>What had he been thinking? Lately, Daniel avoided the near occasion of thinking. Better that way all around.</p> <p>"You needn't go to any trouble," Daniel said, though the warmth of the cottage was heavenly. A kettle steamed on the pot swing, and the scent of cinnamon-a luxury-filled the otherwise humble space. Somebody had made the dwelling comfy, with a rocking chair by the fire, fragrant beeswax candles in the sconces, and braided rugs covering a plank floor.</p> <p>"I can offer you tea, and bread and butter, but then surely we'll be on our way. I'm Kirsten Haddonfield, Mr. Banks, and we can ride to Belle Maison together."</p> <p>Haddonfield was the family name that went with the Bellefonte title.</p> <p>"You're a relative to the earl, then?"</p> <p>She wore a plain, dark blue wool dress, high necked, such as a farmer's wife would wear this time of year. Not even a cousin to an earl would attire herself thus unless she suffered excesses of pragmatism.</p> <p>"I am one of the earl's younger sisters, and you're half-frozen. I hope those aren't your good boots, for you've ruined them."</p> <p>"They're my only boots."</p> <p>Swooping blond brows drew together over a nose no one would call dainty, and yet Lady Kirsten Haddonfield was a pretty woman. She had good facial bones, a definite chin, a clean jaw, and blue eyes that assured Daniel she did not suffer fools-lest her tone leave any doubt on that score.</p> <p>Daniel was a fool. Witness the ease with which the yeoman at the inn had bamboozled him. Witness the ease with which his own wife had bamboozled him.</p> <p>"At least sit for a moment before the fire," the lady said, arranging his scarf and gloves on pegs above the hearth. "Did you lose your way because of the weather?"</p> <p>Daniel had lost his way months ago. "The weather played a role. Are you here alone, my lady?"</p> <p>She folded her arms across a bosom even a man of the cloth acknowledged as a fine bit of work on the Creator's part.</p> <p>"I am on my family's property, Mr. Banks, and they well know where I am. The weather is not only foul, it's dangerous. If you must prance out the door to die for the sake of manners, I'll not stop you. The groom or one of my brothers should be here any minute to fetch me home. We'll note into which ditch your remains have fallen as we pass you by."</p> <p>The fire was lovely. Her ferocity, though arguably rude, warmed Daniel in an entirely different way. Nowhere did the Bible say a Good Samaritan must be excessively burdened with charm.</p> <p>"You aren't much given to polite dissembling, are you, my lady?" For an earl's daughter was a lady from the moment of her birth.</p> <p>She marched over to the sideboard and commenced sawing at a loaf of bread. "I'm not given to any kind of dissembling. You should sit."</p> <p>"If I sit, I might never rise. I've journeyed from Oxfordshire, and the storm seems to have followed me every mile."</p> <p>"Why not tarry in London and wait out the weather?"</p> <p>Because, had Daniel spent another night in London, he'd have been forced to call on a bishop or two and explain why his very own helpmeet hadn't accompanied him to his new post.</p> <p>"I am here to assume responsibility for the Haddondale pulpit," Daniel said, moving closer to the fire. A copy of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman lay open facedown on the mantel. "I was given to understand filling the position was a matter of some urgency."</p> <p>Her ladyship swiped a silver knife through a pat of butter and paused before applying the butter to the bread.</p> <p>"You're the new vicar?"</p> <p>Amusement made this brusque, pretty woman an altogether different creature. She had mischief in her, and humor and secrets, also-where on earth did such thoughts come from?-kisses. Fun, generous kisses.</p> <p>When she smiled, Lady Kirsten looked like the sort of female who'd pat a fellow's bum-in public.</p> <p>The cold had made Daniel daft. "Do I have horns or cloven feet to disqualify me from a religious calling, my lady?"</p> <p>She slapped the butter onto the bread, her movements confident.</p> <p>"You have gorgeous brown eyes, a lovely nose-though it's a bit red at the moment-and a smile that suggests you might get up to tricks, Mr. Banks. You could also use a trim of that brown hair. Ministers aren't supposed to look dashing. I have two younger sisters who will suffer paroxysms of religious conviction if you're to lead the flock."</p> <p>Olivia had found Daniel's nose "unfortunate." Daniel found his entire marriage worthy of the same appellation.</p> <p>Feeling was returning to his feet, and hunger writhed to life along with it. Lady Kirsten passed him the bread without benefit of a plate.</p> <p>"It's not quite fresh, the bread, that is. The butter was made this morning. I'll fix you some tea."</p> <p>Daniel took a small bite, then realized he'd forgotten to send grateful sentiments heavenward before he'd done so. I'm grateful for this bread-also for the company.</p> <p>"Your tea, Mr. Banks. Drink up, for I hear sleigh bells."</p> <p>Daniel downed the hot tea in one glorious go, the sweetness and substance of it fortifying him, much as Lady Kirsten's forthright manner had. She swirled her cloak around her shoulders, then draped his scarf, warm from the fire and redolent of cinnamon, around his neck.</p> <p>"Let me do the explaining," she said, passing him warmed gloves when he'd bolted his bread and butter. "The sleigh will afford us hot bricks and lap robes, but once we get to Belle Maison, we'll hear nothing but questions. Nicholas is protective, and my sisters are infernally curious."</p> <p>She crossed the room to bank the fire, then blew out the candles one by one.</p> <p>Lady Kirsten had been gracious to him, and Daniel wanted to give her something in return for her hospitality. Something real, not mere manners.</p> <p>An impoverished vicar had little to give besides truth.</p> <p>"I'm not lost," he said. "I was misdirected by some fellows at the inn. I asked for the way to Belle Maison, and they sent me here. I did not confuse their directions, either, because I made them repeat their words twice."</p> <p>He'd been taken for a fool, in other words. Again.</p> <p>"The joke is on them, isn't it?" Lady Kirsten said, blowing out the last candle and enshrouding the cottage in deep gloom. "They might have entertained an angel unaware, and instead they'll have a very uncomfortable moment when it's their turn to shake the new vicar's hand. I will enjoy watching that. My sisters will too."</p> <p>She wrapped up the bread and butter and stuffed it in a brown brocade bag, then set the teakettle on the mantel.</p> <p>The sleigh bells went silent, and Daniel sent up a few more words of gratitude. Hot bricks and lap robes would be paradise itself compared to Beelzebub's cold saddle. After he'd tied his horse behind the sleigh, Daniel climbed in beside Lady Kirsten, who wasn't at all shy about sharing the lap robe with him.</p> <p>And that was a bit of paradise too.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>You're not George.</p> <p>Had a woman ever uttered a stupider observation? Kirsten put aside her self-disgust long enough to arrange the lap robe over her knees. Mr. Banks was on her right, Alfrydd, the head lad, on her left, at the reins.</p> <p>A great deal more warmth was to be had on her right.</p> <p>They reached Belle Maison in what felt like moments, before Kirsten could mentally rehearse the version of events she'd offer to her siblings. Not lies. She never bothered lying to them, though they doubtless often wished she would.</p> <p>"Come along, Mr. Banks. Alfrydd will spoil your horse rotten, and very likely the countess will do the same with you."</p> <p>"I'll be but a moment," Mr. Banks said, untying his shaggy black beast from behind the sleigh. Ice beaded the horse's mane and tail, and balls of snow clung to its fetlocks. "Beelzebub has seen me through much this day. I can at least unsaddle him."</p> <p>A parson who named his horse Beelzebub?</p> <p>Kirsten's brothers typically handed their horses off with a pat and a treat, then went striding away to the house, there to track mud, make noise, call for their brandies, and otherwise comport themselves like brothers.</p> <p>Mr. Banks wasn't George, wasn't a brother to Kirsten of any variety but perhaps the theological.</p> <p>"I'll help," she said, "but you need not fear your reception with the earl. Unless you hurl thunderbolts from the pulpit and insult women in the street, you'll be an improvement over your predecessor."</p> <p>Mr. Banks led his mount into the dim, relatively cozy stable, the scents of hay and horse bringing their familiar comfort. Kirsten didn't share her sisters' love of all things fine and pretty, though Mr. Banks had an air of careworn male elegance.</p> <p>"If you'll take the reins, I'll tend to his saddle," Mr. Banks suggested.</p> <p>Kirsten obliged, stroking her glove over a big, horsey Roman nose. "Why did you name him after an imp?" An imp of Satan.</p> <p>"He's blessed with high spirits and a fine sense of humor, though little stops him when he settles to a job."</p> <p>"Your owner treasures you," Kirsten told the horse. The gelding had dark, soft eyes, much like his owner's, and equally fringed in thick lashes. On both man and horse, those eyes had a knowing quality, nothing effeminate or delicate about them.</p> <p>"I treasure my horse, while Zubbie treasures his fodder," Mr. Banks said, unfastening the girth and removing the saddle but not the pad beneath it.</p> <p>Mr. Banks's words held such affection, Kirsten envied the horse.</p> <p>"Have you had him long?" she asked, for there was a bond here, such as Nicholas enjoyed with his mare and George with his gelding. Kirsten's brothers confided in their horses, were comforted by them, and fretted over their horsey ailments as if a child had fallen ill.</p> <p>Men were sentimental about the oddest things.</p> <p>"Beelzebub was a gift," Mr. Banks said, taking the reins from Kirsten and looping them over the horse's neck. "A parishioner getting on in years foaled him out and saw that Beelzebub would be too big and too energetic for an older couple. He was given to me when he was a yearling, and we've been famous friends ever since."</p> <p>Mr. Banks produced a disintegrating lump of sugar from a pocket, and held his hand out to his horse until every evidence of the sugar had been delicately licked away.</p> <p>He patted the gelding, slid the saddle pad from its back, and led the animal into a loose box boasting a veritable featherbed of straw. The bridle came off, and some sentiments were imparted to the horse as Mr. Banks stroked its muscular neck.</p> <p>"Alfrydd will see that he's properly groomed," Kirsten said, because under no circumstances would she allow Mr. Banks to announce himself. She and the vicar would storm the sibling citadel together.</p> <p>Susannah would be especially vulnerable to the kindness in Mr. Banks's eyes, a patient compassion that spoke of woe, sin, and the magnanimity of spirit to accept them both. Della would like the friendliness of those eyes, and Leah, though besotted with Nicholas, was ever one for intelligent conversation.</p> <p>"He likes the chill taken off his water," Mr. Banks said, giving the horse another pat, "and he's a shy lad around the other fellows."</p> <p>"Nicholas prides himself on a well-run stable, Mr. Banks. Beelzebub will be fine. He's nigh three-quarter ton of handsome, equine good health, not a sickly boy on his first night at public school."</p> <p>A shadow crossed Mr. Banks's features, bringing out the weariness a day of winter travel inevitably engendered.</p> <p>"You heard the lady," he said, tweaking one big, equine ear. "Be a good lad, or I'll deal with you severely." He turned to go, and the horse made a halfhearted attempt to nip at his sleeve, which Mr. Banks ignored.</p> <p>"Biting is dangerous behavior," Kirsten said as Mr. Banks left the stall and closed the door. "Why didn't you reprimand him?"</p> <p>She'd wanted to smack the horse. How dare Beelzebub mistreat an owner who plainly loved him?</p> <p>Mr. Banks pulled his gloves out of his pocket and tugged them on. "He wants me to tarry in his stall, and if I turn 'round and spend another minute shaking my finger in his face, he'll have succeeded, won't he? You must be cold, my lady. May I escort you to the house?"</p> <p>He winged an arm. Bits of hay and straw stuck to his sleeve, as well as a quantity of dark horse hairs. Kirsten longed to tarry with him in the barn, to put off th...</p></p><h2>Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World, Revised and Enlarged Edition</h2><p><p> More than a decade after the publication of his dazzling book on the cultural, technological, and manufacturing aspects of measuring time and making clocks, David Landes has significantly expanded <i>Revolution in Time</i>. </p><p> In a new preface and scores of updated passages, he explores new findings about medieval and early-modern time keeping, as well as contemporary hi-tech uses of the watch as mini-computer, cellular phone, and even radio receiver or television screen.

Hannah Bryant, 34, is a successful artist living and painting on a rocky Maine isle. With her parents dead and her younger half-sister, Emily, in a strict religious order, her closest relative had been her great-uncle Arno, with whom she'd spent several summers on Ten Acres No Nine Island, hers when he died. Hannah relishes her seclusion and has "kept the island inviolable," with the exception of someone who's been mysteriously digging holes and a dog, Driftwood, who has washed ashore. When Emily writes to her about a boy in trouble who needs a place to hide, Hannah's staunchly guarded privacy begins to crumble. When more people arrive, they open closets to reveal all sorts of skeletons&#x2014;about Arno's drug business and Hannah's art sales in particular&#x2014;but, mired in detail and stretched across too many pages, the surprises may not be enough to sustain the reader interest. Coomer is a graceful writer, though, conveying natural beauty and emotional turmoil with equal polish. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I was due to start your course "The Devil Has the Best Lines" next Tuesday, but a note from the administration office informs me that due to "oversubscription" my place has been deferred to "a future date as yet unknown."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am writing to tell you just how crushed I am by this news. Since I first read your masterpiece The Truants I have considered your scorching and irreverent commentary as something of a manifesto for life. I applied to this university purely so that I could be taught by you, and on receiving a place immediately requested to study in either of the modules that you offer this term. Since my place in "The Devil Has the Best Lines" was confirmed at the beginning of the summer I have completed the reading list, including a full immersion in the gin-soaked minds of Hunter S. Thompson, Zelda Fitzgerald, and John Cheever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did this mainly in the back room of a pet shop in Reigate where I took a job this summer, cleaning shit out of budgerigar and hamster cages so that I could finance my studies. All of which was made bearable by the idea of being taught by you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So this news is a blow indeed. Considering we have not yet met I can't understand what I have done . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. I ignored it and carried on typing furiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. . . that makes me suddenly less desirable or eligible than another student . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More knocking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It feels, to paraphrase a famous poem, like someone is treading all over my dreams. I am writing this letter as a last-ditch attempt, an appeal to your humanity . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The door banged open. A blond guy with lazy, knowing eyes in a handsome face. Mark, or maybe Max. Second year. Historian. Let's say Max.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment he stared at me in confusion. Then his gaze moved from where I was sitting cross-legged on the bed and roved suspiciously over the contents of the room: bare, Blu Tack-scarred walls, narrow single bed, small hanging wardrobe, my half-unpacked suitcase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sorry, wrong room." He had already turned to go when he twisted round, hand on the doorframe. "Hey . . . Didn't we meet in the bar last night?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded, biting back a sarcastic comment. I have lots of very curly, long dark hair, a wide mouth, and quite a slight figure: Boys notice me briefly, I think, then look elsewhere. Max had patently introduced himself-walking toward me, smiling straight into my eyes-in the hope of chatting up Georgie. A moment of deference toward the friend of the target . . . I knew the score. It had already happened a couple of times last night, enough to make me suspect that my new friend was one of those girls that men find irresistible. Something about her almost too-curvy body, her boyishly cropped blond hair, her sloping, sleepy eyes made everyone-even me-think about sex.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So, Georgie's a good friend of yours?" Max said, sitting down on the end of my bed and pushing back a fringe of newly washed hair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Kind of." If it hadn't been for the letter I'd just been writing, I might have been amused by being used so transparently. Tapping out the end of my sentence, I signed off with a digital flourish: Yours, ever-hopeful, Jessica Walker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You weren't at school together or anything?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Why do you ask?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just wondering. Girls are so tight with girls they've met at school. You seemed kind of into each other." He was one of those guys who was a lot less handsome when he smiled. More of a smirk really, showing too many teeth cluttered in his jaw.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We met last week."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"But you're best friends already." He nodded knowingly. "Do you know where she is? She said she'd come for a coffee with me but I'm sure she said she was in Room 16B. This is 16B, isn't it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nearly laughed. Thanks for that, Georgie. "She's gone home for a few days."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh?" He hesitated for a moment. "To see her boyfriend?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shrugged. "I haven't checked her schedule."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He raised his hands defensively. "Right." He looked at me again, as if being forced to read instructions on a manual that he'd hoped he could bypass. "Remind me your name?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked at the weak, handsome face, his shirt belted into pressed jeans. Minor public school, I hazarded. Father's a chauvinist. Lazy worldview.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The answer is, 'I don't know.'"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You don't know what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't know whether Georgie has a boyfriend."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lobes of his ears went pink, but he managed to pull himself together in time to laugh it off. "I'm sure she has. Just tell her Max stopped by, will you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After he left, I reread the email a couple of times, the cursor hovering over the "send" icon. It was a stupid letter, a childish, petulant letter, written on the back of four days of stomach flu and a wobbly trip to the bar that Georgie had talked me into "because there's only so much Ava Gardner you can get away with before you become Howard Hughes." I had written it for myself really, not actually to send. It was only because it was a Sunday and the administration office was closed, leaving me no place to vent my disappointment, that I had even thought of hunting through the university website to get Dr. Lorna Clay's email address. Then I looked over at my copy of The Truants alone on the shelf above the built-in desk-its pages so well-thumbed that it wouldn't close properly-and thought, Fuck it, what have I got to lose? And with a sudden rush of adrenaline, clicked the mouse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as I snapped shut my laptop, regret settled over me like an itchy blanket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then the itch sank deeper into my bones as I felt myself being dragged backward in time. Back to Boxing Day at home nine months before, with my sister scowling on the sofa as my father made bad jokes about her boyfriend (Dan Pike: plenty more fish in the sea), not understanding that being dumped over Christmas when you're twenty-one doesn't call for a punch line, much less a pun-my dad, who painted fantastical figures in the shed at the end of our garden but left his imagination locked up there, and my older brother, smirking as he stroked the knobby spine of our chocolate Lab, Gladstone, by the fire, and the twins not giving a shit, and my mother not really listening, much less caring, so that in the end I had stood up and walked out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the thing I happened to have in my hand as I walked into the kitchen, a book we had been given at Christmas by Uncle Toto, of all people. That feeling when I read the first few pages of The Truants, my bum warm against the stove and the smell of mince pies, like hot tar, in the air-a book that should have been cleverly irrelevant at best, a book about some drunk, dead writers. Literary criticism-when the hell did that change anyone's life, for God's sake? Except it did, mine. And I knew it would, almost from the first paragraph, because Lorna's voice pulled me in and down, like a riptide carrying you underwater and far out to sea so that when, about page five, I flipped to the author picture on the back and saw her clever, beautiful face and read the sentence about where she taught, I thought: Here she is at last. The person who will take me out of this small, airless world before the banality chokes me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rooms in Halls all had narrow floor-to-ceiling windows. I stood up to open mine, then remembered you couldn't. To discourage suicides, I thought, looking at the gray paving slabs below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Under a flat morning sky, a stream of people was walking away from the zigzag-shaped residence halls, across the scrubby grass toward the gray cinder blocks that made up the back of the canteen. Without the glowing prospect of Lorna's teaching, I was confronted by the drab reality of where I would be living for the next three years: a concrete shithole in the middle of flat, windswept Norfolk on what-if you looked at a map-actually was the bulging arse of the United Kingdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Worse, I would now be shoved into some other, unknown module, most likely with Dr. Porter, who wore skinny black jeans and one earring and had pegged me as a Lorna groupie when I'd come for my interview. No doubt he would be teaching something pretentious and incomprehensible, like "The Phonetics of Postmodernism" or one of those other courses that made me sympathize for a moment with my mother's views on studying English Lit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spots appeared on the window, multiplying rapidly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had started to rain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I waited until I saw Max and his carefully coiffed hair emerge down below and strike off toward the canteen in search of a consolatory bacon-and-egg roll. Then I pulled on some clothes and walked two doors down the corridor. Checking my watch, I knocked loudly and stepped in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was dark and slightly stuffy in Georgie's room. She jackknifed up in the bed, one hand pushing her eye mask up into her blond hair and the other pulling out one of her earplugs and scrabbling for the bedside lamp. When she saw it was me, she sagged back against her pillow with a groan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sorry. But it is midday. And I'm having a crisis."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Georgie pulled out the other earplug. The mask sat across her forehead at a drunken angle, one puffy eye squinting at me. "Oh, hon. Not sick again?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Worse," I said. "Heartsick. Been dumped by Lorna."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My first week at college had been a catastrophe in social terms. Barely an hour after my mother had dropped me off with my suitcases, a peck on the cheek, and a brisk look around the room-</p><p>"Seems clean at least!"-the cramping had begun. Followed by three days of shivering and sweating out a stomach flu in my room, looking glumly through my window at the clump of students that formed and re-formed around the bar, scribbling self-pitying notes in my journal whenever I could summon the energy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the third day, temperature still raging, a fuzz at the edges of my vision, I dragged myself down to the introductory English drinks. Which was when Georgie, wearing tight, faded jeans and silver sneakers, her bleached hair cropped high to the hairline on her long, fine neck, had sidled over to me. "Ugly bunch, aren't they, English students?" she muttered, talking out of the side of her mouth like a gangster as the white-haired dean of studies gave a turgid welcome speech. "Can you believe Lorna didn't show at her own party? A living legend, that woman. Rumor has it she's seeing my supervisor, Professor Steadman." Georgie pointed to a tall, bespectacled man with gray hair. "But that can't be right, surely . . ." She paused, looking at me more closely. "Hey, do you know your teeth are chattering?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next day, to my delight, she turned up at my door with armfuls of chocolates and sweets that she announced, loudly, were "munchies" ("There's a rumor going around that you've been smoking weed in your room all week. This will fan the flames nicely"); two different kinds of prescription painkiller ("Tuck in, plenty more where they came from"); and a magazine jammed full of photos of horsey-looking aristocrats at parties ("Don't knock it. I'm related to half of them and have kissed most of the rest. Look at this guy, Tristan Burton-Hill. He's so posh he can't actually close his mouth . . .").</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the next couple of days, to my surprise, she kept popping by: one day sitting at the end of my bed with a wheel of hard cheese, which she hacked at with a teaspoon until it bent, the next bringing a handful of wildflowers that looked like dirty daisies, which she had picked by the lake on campus. "They're called sneezewort, for your dribbly nose. I went through a stage of pressing wildflowers as a kid. I learned the whole wildflower encyclopedia, which is kind of weird, looking back at it. Amazing what an only child will do to pass the time. Then I got into pottery and made endless shitty bowls. I mean, endless. Got away with about five years of never buying a single Christmas present. Shall I put them in your tooth-mug? How are you feeling today? Still got the shits both ends?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was the thing about Georgie. She changed tone so fast that your head whirled. Mostly, she was like a slot machine flashing all its lights in constant jackpot, but there was a kindness there, and in amidst the glib, smart chatter, beguiling glimpses of something more tender.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ask to be put in the Christie module with me?" she suggested now, from beneath her crooked eye mask. "Wouldn't that be a laugh?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Georgie was doing joint honors in Philosophy and English. She claimed the Philosophy part was just to make her "sound more attractive," but I already had a strong sense that, despite her air of careless hedonism, she was also whip-smart, secretly studious, and heavily invested in showing her parents-"neglectful narcissists, the pair of them"-just how fucking clever she was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I nodded. "I did wonder. But it's bound to be full, too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing that Lorna was renowned for, apart from the cult status of The Truants, was "rescuing" female authors who had been lost or dismissed from the canon as irrelevant. One of these "personal revisionism" courses was on Agatha Christie, about whom, rumor had it, she was now writing a book. When I'd signed up for the modules online I'd looked at Lorna's Christie course, "Murdered by the Campus," with a flicker of longing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my early teens, thanks to an old lady I'd visit in Reigate, Stella, I'd read a lot of Agatha Christie out loud. In my later teens, I started reading them for myself-a bit of fun in between more serious books. But although I loved the cat's cradle of the plot, the way the clues and red herrings were stitched together, I knew the characters were thin at best and the themes scant: I couldn't see how even Lorna would make this into an actual undergrad course. So I hadn't hesitated long before clicking on her other module, "The Devil Has the Best Lines."</p></p><h2>Nine Day Queen of England: Lady Jane Grey</h2><p>Lady Jane Grey has often been called the &#39;Tudor Pawn&#39; but to see her as one whose life was simply moved around by others is totally inadequate. This is no simplistic life and death of a sixteen-year-old girl. In order to understand the full tragedy and triumph of her life it is vital to grasp the far-reaching political and religious changes that were shaking England at that time. The Reformation touched the whole population; from palace to university; from emerging town to peasant cottage. Like the pieces of a jigsaw, the pieces come together to give a picture of a girl with outstanding natural abilities, whose strength of character and remarkable faith shine out despite the darkness that often surrounded her. Execution at age 16, Jane paid an awful price for a throne she did not seek.</p><p>Faith Cook was born in China, the daughter of OMF missionaries, and now lives in Derbyshire, England.

Filled with historic photographs, old engravings, maps and illustrations carefully reproduced and printed, this hardcover captures a sense of the Jersey Shore that residents and visitors long for today.<br><p>Readers will rediscover the lost resort of Sea Haven and Tucker's Island in this book, they will ride the Tuckerton and Long Beach railroads to the new resort of Beach Haven, stay in its delightful and airy seashore hotels, and stroll its elegant boardwalk. They will experience the fear of the legendary 1916 shark attacks, visit the early gunning and yacht clubs, and watch pound fishermen haul in boats brimming with fish caught just off the beach. John Bailey Lloyd's wonderful writing style, combined with extraordinary old images, will fill readers with a true sense of place.</p></p><p>John Bailey Lloyd was an author, librarian, newspaper columnist, speaker, and historian on Long Beach Island at the New Jersey Shore. Frequently referred to as ''Long Beach Island's historian'', although no such official position existed, he was employed as a reference librarian in the Ocean County Library System. But his passion was for local history and, an engaging speaker, he gave weekly talks on shore history at standing-room-only programs in his home town of Beach Haven for two decades.<br><p> He wrote a widely-read column and historical features for the island's newspapers, and authored three best-selling books, including: Six Miles At Sea and Two Centuries of History. The books focused on Long Beach Island, but captured much of the history of the entire Shore. He also wrote biographical introductions to other books, including The Tides of Barnegat, by F. Hopkinson Smith, and a short story included in the literary anthology Shore Stories. He provided material and the basis for three historical videos, including programs about the Barnegat Lighthouse and the ''Lost Resort of Sea Haven: Tucker's Island.''<br></p><p> Born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1932, he had been on Long Beach Island since he was ten years old -- in time to see old landmarks like the Beach Haven boardwalk, the Engleside Hotel and the vast emptiness of the Island as it once was. With time out for service in the Coast Guard, graduate school and some travel, he spent nearly every summer on the Island, and in 1977 his family became permanent residents and moved into their Beach Haven summer home -- an 1879 three-story Victorian. He died in 2003 at age 71.</p></p><h2>What Remains of Heaven</h2><p>For New condition books in our store; You will be the first user. You will be the first to open the book cover.

Collects issues #13-18.</p><p>Once an editor for Wildstorm, John Layman turned to writing comics full-time in 2002 and mainly wrote for Marvel Comics. However, he is mostly known for his creator-owned titles at Image Comics, such as the graphic novel Puffed and the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning series Chew. He currently writes the monthly adventures of the Dark Knight in DETECTIVE COMICS.After a sluggish start to Detective Comics, Layman, critical darling and author of the runaway hit Chew, has taken over as series writer and, thankfully, brings his signature wit and marvelous storytelling along with him. This installment of the series sends Batman on a wild penguin chase across the rooftops of Gotham City, where he finds himself fighting a classic rogue&#x2019;s gallery of Poison Ivy, Clayface, and Merrymaker. What the Dark Knight doesn&#x2019;t expect is a rising criminal star, looking to take over the Penguin&#x2019;s territory. Layman takes the Caped Crusader back to his detective roots, complete with a crossover tie-in as the Joker turns Gotham City into his own twisted playground. Though Layman&#x2019;s name on the cover will be the big draw, artists Fabok and Clarke are up to the challenge, often delivering outside-the-box paneling and vibrant splash pages. In his first arc on the series, Layman&#x2019;s approach to Batman is both delightfully nostalgic and surprisingly new, making this a perfect fit for fans of classic Batman. --Ben Spanner</p><h2>Look Inside a Castle (Usborne Look Inside)</h2><p>This is an innovative flap book offering a fascinating glimpse into the world of sports.

Please comment.</i></p> <p>I have told you that a woman is to be loved, not understood. That is the first understanding.</p> <p>Life is so mysterious that our hands cannot reach to its heights, our eyes cannot look into its deepest mystery. Understanding any expression of existence&#x2014;men or women or trees or animals or birds&#x2014;is the function of science, not of a mystic. I am not a scientist. To me, science itself is a mystery, and now scientists have started to recognize it. They are dropping their old, stubborn, superstitious attitude that one day they will know all that is to be known.</p> <p>With Albert Einstein the whole history of science has taken a very different route because the more he went into the deepest core of matter, the more he became puzzled. All logic was left behind, all rationality was left behind. You cannot dictate to existence, because it does not follow your logic. Logic is man-made. There was a point in Albert Einstein&#x2019;s life when he remembers that he was wavering about whether to insist on being rational&nbsp;&#x2026; but that would be foolish. It would be human, but not intelligent. Even if you insist on logic, on rationality, existence is not going to change according to your logic; your logic has to change according to existence. And the deeper you go, existence becomes more and more mysterious. A point comes when you have to leave logic and rationality and just listen to nature. I call it the ultimate understanding&#x2014;but not in the ordinary sense of understanding. You know it, you feel it, but there is no way to say it.</p> <p>Man is a mystery, woman is a mystery, everything that exists is a mystery&#x2014;and all our efforts to figure it out are going to fail.</p> <p>I am reminded of a man who was purchasing in a toy shop a present for his son for Christmas. He was a well-known mathematician, so naturally the shopkeeper brought out a jigsaw puzzle. The mathematician tried&nbsp;&#x2026; it was a beautiful puzzle. He tried and tried and tried and started perspiring. It was becoming awkward. The customers and the salesmen and the shopkeeper were all watching, and he was not able to bring the puzzle to a solution. Finally he dropped the idea and he shouted at the shopkeeper: &#x201c;I am a mathematician and if I cannot solve this jigsaw puzzle, how do you think my small boy will be able to?&#x201d;</p> <p>The shopkeeper said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand. It is made in such a way that nobody can solve it&#x2014;mathematician or no mathematician.&#x201d;</p> <p>The mathematician asked, &#x201c;But why is it made in this way?&#x201d;</p> <p>The shopkeeper said, &#x201c;It is made in this way so that the boy from the very beginning starts learning that life cannot be solved, cannot be understood.&#x201d;</p> <p>You can live it, you can rejoice in it, you can become one with the mystery, but the idea of understanding as an observer is not at all possible.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t understand myself. The greatest mystery to me is myself. But a few clues I can give to you:</p> <p>A psychiatrist is a fellow who asks you a lot of expensive questions that your wife asks you for nothing.</p> <p>The key to happiness: You may speak of love and tenderness and passion, but real ecstasy is discovering you haven&#x2019;t lost your keys after all.</p> <p>Women begin by resisting a man&#x2019;s advances and end by blocking his retreat.</p> <p>If you want to change a woman&#x2019;s mind, agree with her.</p> <p>If you want to know what a woman really means, look at her&#x2014;don&#x2019;t listen to her.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The lady walked up to the policeman and said, &#x201c;Officer, that man on the corner is annoying me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have been watching the whole time,&#x201d; said the cop, &#x201c;and that man wasn&#x2019;t even looking at you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said the woman, &#x201c;isn&#x2019;t that annoying?&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The romantic young man turned to the beautiful young girl in his bed and asked, &#x201c;Am I the first man you ever made love to?&#x201d;</p> <p>She thought for a moment and then said, &#x201c;You could be&#x2014;I have a terrible memory for faces.&#x201d;</p> <p>Everything is mysterious: It is better to enjoy it rather than trying to understand it. Ultimately the man who goes on trying to understand life proves to be a fool, and the man who enjoys life becomes wise and goes on enjoying life, because he becomes more and more aware of the mysterious that surrounds us.</p> <p>The greatest understanding is to know that nothing can be understood, that all is mysterious and miraculous. To me this is the beginning of religiousness in your life.</p> <p><i>Would you please explain what the real differences between men and women are?</i></p> <p>Most of the differences between men and women are because of thousands of years of conditioning; they are not fundamental to nature. But there are a few differences which give them unique beauty, individuality. Those differences can be counted very easily.</p> <p>One is that the woman is capable of producing life; man is not. In that way he is inferior, and that inferiority has played a great role in the domination of women by men. The inferiority complex works in this way: It pretends to be superior&#x2014;to deceive oneself and to deceive the whole world. So man down the ages has been trying to destroy the woman&#x2019;s genius, talents, capacities, so that he can prove himself superior&#x2014;to himself and to the world.</p> <p>Because the woman gives birth, for nine months or more she remains absolutely vulnerable, dependent on man. Men have exploited this in a very ugly way. And that is a physiological difference; it makes no difference at all. The psychology of the woman is corrupted by man telling her things which are not true, making her a slave to man, reducing her to a secondary citizen of the world. And the reason for that was that he is muscularly more powerful. But the muscular power is part of animality. If that is going to decide the superiority, then many animals are more muscular than a man.</p> <p>But the real differences are certainly there, and we have to search for them behind the pile of invented differences. One difference I see is that a woman is more capable of love than a man is. A man&#x2019;s love is more or less a physical necessity; a woman&#x2019;s love is not. It is something greater and higher, it is a spiritual experience. That&#x2019;s why the woman is monogamous and man is polygamous. The man would like to have all the world&#x2019;s women, and still he would not be satisfied. His discontent is infinite.</p> <p>The woman can be satisfied with one love, utterly fulfilled, because she does not look at the body of the man, she looks at his innermost qualities. She does not fall in love with a man who has a beautiful muscular body, she falls in love with a man who has charisma&#x2014;something indefinable, but immensely attractive&#x2014;who has a mystery to be explored. She wants her man not to be just a man, but an adventure in discovering consciousness.</p> <p>The man is very weak as far as sexuality is concerned; he can have only one orgasm. The woman is infinitely superior; she can have multiple orgasms. And this has been one of the most troublesome matters. The man&#x2019;s orgasm is local, confined to his genitals. The woman&#x2019;s orgasm is total, not confined to the genitals. Her whole body is sexual, and she can have a beautiful orgasmic experience a thousandfold bigger, deeper, more enriching, more nourishing than a man can have.</p> <p>But her whole body has to be aroused, and the tragedy is that man is not interested in it. He has never been interested in it. He has used the woman as a sex machine just to relieve his own sexual tensions. Within seconds he is finished, and by the time he is finished the woman has not even begun. The moment a man is finished making love he turns and goes to sleep. The sexual act helps him to have a good sleep&#x2014;more relaxed, with all the tensions released in the sexual activity. And every woman has cried and wept when she has seen this. She had not even started, she had not moved. She has been used, and that is the ugliest thing in life: When you are used as a thing, as a mechanism, as an object. She cannot forgive the man for using her.</p> <p>To make the woman also an orgasmic partner the man has to learn foreplay, to be in no hurry to go to bed. He has to make <i>love</i> something of an art. They can have a place&#x2014;a love temple&#x2014;where incense is burning, no glaring lights, just candles. And he should approach the woman when he is in a beautiful mood, joyous, so he can share. What happens ordinarily is that men and women fight before they make love. That poisons love. Love is a kind of treaty, a sign that the fight is finished&#x2014;at least for tonight. It is a bribe, it is cheating.</p> <p>A man should make love the way a painter paints&#x2014;when he feels the urge filling his heart&#x2014;or the way the poet composes poetry, or a musician plays music. The woman&#x2019;s body should be taken as a musical instrument; it is. When the man is feeling joy, then sex is not just a release, a relaxation, a sleeping method. Then there is foreplay. He dances with the woman, he sings with the woman&#x2014;with beautiful music vibrating the love temple, with the incense that they love. It should be something of the sacred, because there is nothing sacred in ordinary life unless you make love sacred. And that will be the beginning of opening the door to the whole phenomenon of superconsciousness.</p> <p>Love never should be forced, love never should be an attempt. It should not be in the mind at all&#x2014;you are playing, dancing, singing, enjoying&nbsp;&#x2026; part of this long joy. If it happens, then it is beautiful. When love happens, it has beauty. When it is made to happen, it is ugly.</p> <p>And while you are making love with the man on top of the woman&nbsp;&#x2026; it is known as the missionary posture. The East became aware of this ugliness that the man was heavier, taller, and more muscular; he was crushing a delicate being. In the East, the way has always been just the opposite: the woman on top. Crushed under the weight of the man, the woman has no mobility. Only the man moves, so he comes to orgasm within seconds and the woman is simply in tears. She has been a partner, but she was not involved in it. She has been used.</p> <p>When the woman is on top she has more mobility, the man has less mobility, and that will bring their orgasms closer to each other. And when both go into orgasmic experience, it is something of the other world. It is the first glimpse of <i>samadhi</i>; it is the first glimpse that one is not the body. One forgets the body, one forgets the world. Both the man and the woman move into a new dimension they have never explored.</p> <p>The woman has the capacity for multiple orgasms, so the man has to be as slow as possible. But the reality is, he is in such a hurry in everything that he destroys the whole relationship. He should be very relaxed so that the woman can have multiple orgasms. His orgasm should come at the end, when the woman&#x2019;s orgasm has reached to the peak. It is a simple question of understanding.</p> <p>These are natural differences&#x2014;they have nothing to do with conditioning. There are other differences. For example, a woman is more centered than a man. She is more serene, more silent, more patient, is capable of waiting. Perhaps because of these qualities she has more resistance to diseases and she lives longer than a man. Because of her serenity, her delicateness, she can fulfill a man&#x2019;s life immensely. She can surround man&#x2019;s life in a very soothing, cozy atmosphere. But the man is afraid&#x2014;he does not want to be surrounded by the woman, he does not want to let her create a cozy warmth around him. He is afraid because that way he will become dependent. So for centuries he has been keeping her at a distance. And he is afraid because he knows deep down that the woman is more than he is. She can give birth to life. Nature has chosen her to reproduce, not man.</p> <p>Man&#x2019;s function in reproduction is almost nil. This inferiority has created the greatest problem&#x2014;man started cutting the woman&#x2019;s wings. He started in every way reducing her, condemning her, so that he could at least believe that he is superior. He has treated women as cattle&#x2014;even worse. In China, for thousands of years, the woman was not thought to have a soul, so the husband could kill her and the law would not interfere&#x2014;she was his possession. If he wanted to destroy his furniture, it was not illegal. If he wanted to destroy his woman, it was not illegal. This is the ultimate insult&#x2014;that the woman has no soul.</p> <p>Man has deprived woman of education, of financial independence. He has deprived her of social mobility because he is afraid. He knows she is superior, he knows she is beautiful, he knows that giving her independence will create danger. So down the centuries there has been no independence for women. The Mohammedan woman even has to keep her face covered so that except her husband, nobody can see the beauty of her face, the depth of her eyes.</p> <p>In Hinduism, the woman had to die when the husband died. What a great jealousy! You have possessed her your whole life, and even after death you want to possess her. You are afraid. She is beautiful, and when you are gone, who knows? She may find another partner, perhaps better than you. So the system of <i>sati</i> prevailed for thousands of years&#x2014;the most ugly phenomenon you can imagine.</p> <p>Man is very egoistic. That&#x2019;s why I call him male chauvinistic. Man has created this society, and in this society there is no place for the woman. And she has tremendous qualities of her own! For example, if man has the possibility of intelligence, the woman has the possibility of love. It does not mean she cannot have intelligence; she can have intelligence, she just has to be given the chance to develop it. But love she is born with&#x2014;she has more compassion, more kindness, more understanding. Man and woman are two strings of one harp, but both are in suffering separate from each other. And because they are suffering and do not know the reason, they start taking revenge on each other.</p> <p>The woman can be of immense help in creating an organic society. She is different from man, but not unequal. She is as equal to a man as any other man. She has talents of her own which are absolutely needed. It is not enough to earn money, it is not enough to become a success in the world; more necessary is a beautiful home, and the woman has the capacity to change any house into a home. She can fill it with love; she has that sensitivity. She can rejuvenate man, help him relax.</p> <p>In the <i>Upanishads</i> there is a very strange blessing for new couples. A new couple comes to the seer of the <i>Upanishads</i> and he gives his blessing. He says to the girl specifically, &#x201c;I hope you will become a mother of ten children, and finally, your husband will be your eleventh child. And unless you become a mother to your husband, you have not succeeded in being a true wife.&#x201d; It is very strange but has immense psychological insight in it, because this is what the modern psychology finds, that every man is looking for his mother in the woman and every woman is looking for her father in the man.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why every marriage is a failure: You cannot find your mother. The woman you have married has not come to your house to be your mother, she wants to be your wife, a lover. But the Upanishadic blessing, almost five thousand or six thousand years old, gives an insight to modern psychology. A woman, whatsoever she is, is basically a mother. A father is an invented institution, it is not natural. But the mother will remain indispensable. They have tried experiments: They have given children all the facilities, medication, all the food&nbsp;&#x2026; every perfection from different branches of science, but strangely the children go on shrinking and will die within months. Then they discovered that the mother&#x2019;s...</p></p><h2>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron: The War of 1812 and the Forging of the American Navy (Early America Collection)</h2><p>The War of 1812 is typically noted for a handful of events: the burning of the White House, the rise of the Star Spangled Banner, and the battle of New Orleans. But in fact the greatest consequence of that distant conflict was the birth of the U.S. Navy. During the War of 1812, America&#x2019;s tiny fleet took on the mightiest naval power on earth, besting the British in a string of victories that stunned both nations.<br> <br>In his new book, <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron: The War of 1812 and the Birth of the American Navy</i>, author <b>Dr. Ronald Utt</b> not only sheds new light on the naval battles of the War of 1812 and how they gave birth to our nation&#x2019;s great navy, but tells the story of the War of 1812 through the portraits of famous American war heroes. From the cunning Stephen Decatur to the fierce David Porter, <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i> relates how thousands of American men and boys gave better than they got against the British Navy. The great age of fighting sail is as rich in heroic drama as any epoch.<br> <br>Dr. Utt&#x2019;s <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i> retrieves the American chapter of that epoch from unjustified obscurity, and offers readers an intriguing chronicle of the War of 1812 as well as a unique perspective on the birth of the U.S. Navy.</p><p><b>The Forgotten War Forgotten No Longer</b><br><br>All of us have heard of the War of 1812, but how many of us actually know anything about it about Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s rousing defense of New Orleans, the burning of the White House, and most especially the swashbuckling war at sea in which the young United States Navy manhandled the greatest naval power on the planet?<br><br>If you've ever wanted to learn about the United States Navy&#x2019;s first great war at sea, you&#x2019;re in for a treat with <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i>. From his years of research and passion for the age of fighting sail,&#x201d; author Ronald Utt provides a panoramic view of the naval War of 1812 rich in high-seas heroism, captivating in anecdote and detail rescuing some of the Navy&#x2019;s greatest historical triumphs from undeserved oblivion.<br><br><i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i> is a stirring account of how an American fleet of only seventeen ships bested the five-hundred-ship-strong Royal Navy in a string of early victories that astonished both sides, highlighting how American courage, gunnery, and skill could prove itself against the most daunting odds. Ronald Utt paints vivid portraits of the heroes including Stephen Decatur, James Don&#x2019;t Give Up the Ship!&#x201d; Lawrence, Oliver Hazard Perry, and Francis Scott Key to give readers an unforgettable experience of the War of 1812. If you are interested in American history, the history of the United States Navy, or just plain real-life adventure stories, you owe it to yourself to read <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i>.<b>PRAISE FOR <i>Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron</i></b><br><br> At a time when America seems to flinch at threats from the world&#x2019;s petty tyrants, our forefathers&#x2019; defiance two centuries ago of the mightiest empire on earth should stiffen our spines.

Counsels on voluntary poverty or celibacy, for instance, have been seen as an option for a small minority of Christ&#x2019;s followers. The same cannot be said about the love of enemies. This does not fall in the &#x201c;if you would be perfect&#x201d; category. It is, instead, basic Christianity, which Jesus taught through direct instruction, through parables, and by the example given with his own life. And yet it is undoubtedly the hardest commandment of all, one that runs counter to our natural inclinations. It is, as Jim Forest shows, a commandment that calls for prayer, discernment, and constant practice. Along with reflections drawn from scripture, the lives of the saints, and modern history, Forest offers &#x201c;nine disciplines of active love,&#x201d; including &#x201c;praying for enemies,&#x201d; &#x201c;turning the other cheek,&#x201d; &#x201c;forgiveness,&#x201d; and &#x201c;recognizing Jesus in others,&#x201d; that make the love of enemies, if not an easier task, then a goal worth striving toward in our daily lives.</p><p><b>Jim Forest</b> is an internationally renowned peacemaker and spiritual writer. His many books include <i>All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day, Living with Wisdom: A Life of Thomas Merton, Praying with Icons</i>, and <i>Ladder of the Beatitudes</i>.<i>"Jim Forest reflects on the most difficult of all Jesus's sayings, and he does so in his trademark style: with wisdom, compassion and courage . . . He shows us that while it may be a 'hard teaching' it is also a liberating one. For forgiveness liberates not only the one forgiven but the one who forgives."</i> --<b>James Martin, SJ,</b> author, <i>Jesus: A Pilgrimage</i><br><br><i>"A statement of the gospel challenge and the gospel hope so clear that it is frightening: this is real, this is possible, this cannot be written off - and this demands change here and now in me. A book to be deeply grateful for."</i> --<b>Rowan Williams, </b>Magdalen College, Cambridge University<br><br><i>"One emerges from this inspiring volume persuaded by Martin Luther King, who taught that 'this command is an absolute necessity for the survival of our civilization,' and by Forest, who guides us to dare to believe that we are capable of such love in our lives."</i> --<b>Rabbi Amy Eilberg</b>, author, <i>From Enemy to Friend</i><br><br><i>"Jim Forest's reflections peel back all the ideologies we Christians rely on to justify violence and war and reveal the peace that lies at the heart of the Gospel. Jim is a superb storyteller, a master of the anecdote, a witness to the quiet power of peacemaking in the world. These reflections and mediations should be read slowly, carefully, prayerfully, again and again."</i> <b>--Michael Baxter,</b> Associate Professor of Catholic Studies, DePaul University<br><br><i>"With the profound wisdom gained from a life devoted to peacemaking, Jim Forest examines the dark nature of our enmities and suggests ways of breaking down walls of hatred and of learning to forgive--for the sake of world peace and our own personal healing.

It is also hugely fun to read."<br>--Boston Globe<br><br>Why do people raised in the same families often differ more dramatically in personality than those from different families? What made Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, and Voltaire uniquely suited to challenge the conventional wisdom of their times? This pioneering inquiry into the significance of birth order answers both these questions with a conceptual boldness that has made critics compare it with the work of Freud and of Darwin himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Frank J. Sulloway envisions families as ecosystems in which siblings compete for parental favor by occupying specialized niches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Combing through thousands of biographies in politics, science, and religion, he demonstrates that firstborn children are more likely to identify with authority whereas their younger siblings are predisposed to rise against it. Family dynamics, Sulloway concludes, is a primary engine of historical change. Elegantly written, masterfully researched, Born to Rebel is a grand achievement that has galvanized historians and social scientists and will fascinate anyone who has ever pondered the enigma of human character.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"Daring . . . a stunning achievement. "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--The New York Times Book Review</p><p>This groundbreaking book takes on the influence of birth order in personalities and offers some surprising conclusions. Frank J. Sulloway, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has undertaken the first comprehensive study of birth order in determining personality and social outlook. He produces overwhelming evidence that, because of the evolutionary hierarchy in families, first-born children are more likely to be conformists while the later-borns tend to be more creative and more likely to reject the status quo. He documents just how different siblings are from each another--a person tends to have more in common with any randomly chosen person of their own age than with a sibling--and explains why sibling differences occur. The book offers new insights into the determining factors of who we are and who our children will be, and it is unlike any research yet published.Frank J. Sulloway has a Ph.D. from Harvard.

You want to improve their performance and think you know what they should do. You estimate the conversation should only take a few minutes, yet somehow 45 minutes later you're still going around in circles. Sound familiar?</p><p>Unfortunately, improving human performance involves one of the hardest challenges in the known universe: changing the way people think. In constant demand as a coach, speaker, and consultant to companies around the world, David Rock has proven the secret to leading people (and living and working with them) is found in the space between our ears. "If people are being paid to think," he writes, "isn't it time the business world found out what the thing doing the work, the brain, is all about?"</p><p>Supported by the latest groundbreaking research, <em>Quiet Leadership</em> provides, for the first time, a brain-based approach that will help busy leaders, executives, and managers improve their own and their colleagues' performance.</p><p><em>Quiet Leadership</em> is for the CEO who wants to be more effective at inspiring his or her leadership team, but has just a few minutes each week to speak to them. It's for the executive who'd like to get a manager to plan more effectively, but can't seem to work out how. It's for the manager who wants to inspire the sales team, but isn't sure how to do it. It's for the human resources professional who is ready to take on changing the culture of a whole organization. It's for the parent or caregiver who wants to reach new levels of communication and understanding with their family members.</p><p>Quiet leaders are masters at bringing out the best performance in others. They improve the thinking of people around them&#x2014;literally improving the way their brains process information&#x2014;without telling anyone what to do. Given how many people in today's companies are being paid to think and analyze, improving our thinking is one of the fastest ways to improve performance.</p><p><em>Quiet Leadership</em> offers a practical, six-step guide to making permanent workplace performance change by unleashing higher productivity, new levels of morale, and greater job satisfaction.

He lives in Sydney, Australia, and New York City.</p>A leader's job "should be to help people make their own connections," Rock asserts&#x2014;a commonsense message he overcomplicates in this guide for executives and managers who want to improve employee performance. Rock, CEO of Results Coaching System, strives to legitimize his methodology with neuroscience, acronyms and catchphrases and gratuitous, Powerpointesque illustrations. But his writing style conflicts with his advice&#x2014;keep it succinct and focused. Promising that his approach "<i>saves time </i>and<i> creates energy,</i>" he details his six steps: "Think About Thinking" (let people think things through without telling them what to do, while remaining "solutions-focused"); "Listen for Potential" (be a sounding board for employees); "Speak with Intent" (clarify and streamline conversation); "Dance Toward Insight" (communicate in ways that promote other people's insights); "CREATE New Thinking" (which stands for Current Reality, Explore Alternatives and Tap Their Energy, an acronym about "helping people turn their insights into habits"); and, finally, "Follow Up" to ensure ongoing improved performance. Rock also explains how to apply the steps to problem solving, decision making and giving feedback. Perhaps Rock conveys his strategies more effectively in a seminar setting, but for busy executives, this guide (after <i>Personal Best</i>) is more likely to generate frustration than an " 'aha' moment." <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In normal times, we would use a linear scale to plot progress. The height of our graph would be proportional to the measure of progress. But we live at a remarkable moment in history, when progress is so rapid that we plot it on a logarithmic scale.<br>In the field of computing we have become accustomed to measures that double every few years--processor speeds, communication bandwidths, the number of sites on the Internet--so we plot them on a scale that shows each order of magnitude as an equal step. By plotting on a log-labeled scale (1,10,100,1000) we can imagine progress as a straight line, moving steadily upward with the advance of time. This gives us a comfortable illusion of predictability.<br>Of course, if we used a linear scale to plot these same curves, they would not look so tame. They would be exponentials, shooting uncontrollably off the page. They would make it look as if everything that has happened so far is an insignificant prelude to what will happen next. On a linear scale, the exponents look unpredictable. The curves approach vertical, converging on a singularity, where the rules break down and something different begins.<br>The two ways of plotting progress correspond to different attitudes about technological change. I see the merits in both. As an engineer, I am an extrapolator. I am a believer in, and a I participant in, the march of progress. As an engineer, I like semi-log scales. But I am also a parent, a citizen, a teacher, and a student. I am an object, not just an agent of change. As an object and as an observer, I can see clearly that there is something extraordinary going on. The explosion of the exponentials reveals a truth: We are alive at a special and important moment. We are becoming something else.<br>This century, fifty years back and fifty forward, is one of those rare times in history when humanity transforms from one type of human society to another. To use a physical analogy, we are in the midst of a phase transition, when the configuration of the system is switching between two locally stable states. In this transition, technology is the catalyst. It is a self-amplifying agent of change, in the sense that each improvement tends to increase its capacity to improve. Better machines enable us to build even better machines. Faster computers let us design faster computers, faster.<br>Change was not always like this. For most of human history, parents could expect their grandchildren to grow up in a world much like their own. For most of human history, parents knew what they needed to know to teach their children. Planning for the future was easier then. Architects designed cathedrals that would take centuries to complete. Farmers planted acorns to shade their descendants with oaks. Today, starting a project that would not be completed for century or two would seem odd. Today, any plan more than a year is &#x201c;long-term.&#x201d;<br>Why have we become so shortsighted? We have no less goodwill than our ancestors. Our problem is that, literally, we cannot imagine the future. The pace of technological change is so great that we cannot know what type of world we are leaving for our children. If we plant acorns, we cannot reasonably expect that our children will sit under the oak trees. Or that they will even want to. The world is changing too fast for that. People move. Needs change. Much of our generation is employed at jobs our parents never imagined. Entire industries, indeed entire nations, can wither in the blink of an eye.<br>All of this confusion becomes understandable, even expected, if we accept the premise that we are in a time of transition from one type of society to another. We should expect to understand the occupations of our grandchildren no more than a hunter-gatherer would understand the life of a farmer, or than a preindustrial farmer would understand the life of a factory worker. All we can really expect to understand is the good in what we leave behind.<br>So what are we humans becoming? Whatever it is is more connected, more interdependent. Few individuals today could survive outside the fabric of society. No city could stand alone without being continuously fed from the outside by networks of power, water, food, and information. Few nations could maintain their lifestyles without trade. The web of our technology weaves us together, simultaneously enabling us and forcing us to depend more on one another.<br>As we are becoming more deeply connected to each other, we are simultaneously becoming more connected with our creations. Each time I watch a worker on an assembly line, a violinist with a violin, or a child with a computer, I am struck by how intimate we have become with our technology. Already, our contact lenses and our pacemakers are as much a part of us as our hair and teeth. With recombinant biotechnology we will blur the final boundary between artifacts and ourselves.<br>In 1851, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote, &#x201c;Is it a fact--or have I dreamed it--that, by means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve, vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time? Rather, the round globe is a vast head, a brain, instinct with intelligence!&#x201d; Now, more than a century later, we can see the signs of his vision. The collective intelligence of the world&#x2019;s minds, biological and electronic, already make many of our economic decisions. The prices of commodities and the rates of global growth are determined by this network of people and machines in ways that surpass the understanding of any single human mind. The phone system and the Internet have short-circuited distance, literally &#x201c;vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time.&#x201d;<br>There are other, subtler signs that we are becoming a part of a symbiotic whole. It is obvious that we have become more narrowly specialized in our professions, but we are also becoming more specialized in the activities of our daily lives.<br>Increasingly we fragment our activities into pure components. We either work or play, exercise or relax, teach or learn. We divide our art, our science, our politics, and our religion into carefully separated spheres. There was an older kind of human that kept these things together, a kind a person who worked and played and taught and learned all at the same time. That kind of person is becoming obsolete. Integration demands standardization. Just as a single cell in our body is adapted to a specific function and a specific time, we too must focus our roles. An earlier kind of cell could sense, move, digest, and reproduce continuously, but such a self-sufficient unit cannot function as a part of a complex whole.<br>I cannot help but feel ambivalent at the prospect of this brave new world, in which I will be a small part of a symbiotic organism that I can barely comprehend. But then, I am a product of another kind of society, one that celebrates the individual. My sense of identity, my very sense of survival, is based on a resistance to becoming something else. Just as one of my hunting-gathering ancestors would surely reject my modern city life, so do I feel myself rebelling at this metamorphosis. This is natural. I imagine that caterpillars are skeptical of butterflies.<br>As frightened as I am by the prospect of this change, I am also thrilled by it. I love what we are, yet I cannot help but hope that we are capable of turning into something better. We humans can be selfish, foolish, shortsighted, even cruel. Just as I can imagine these weaknesses as vestiges of our (almost) discarded animal past, I can imagine our best traits--our kindness, our creativity, our capacity to love--as hints of our future. This is the basis for my hope.<br>I know I am a relic. I am a presymbiotic kind of person, born during the time of our transition. Yet, I feel lucky to have been given a glimpse of our promise. I am overwhelmed when I think of it...by the sweet sad love of what we were, and by the frightening beauty of what we might become.<br><br>Copyright � 2001 by Vernor Vinge</p></p><h2>Yoga: The Science of the Soul</h2><p><p><b>In <i>Yoga: The Science of the Soul</i>, one of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century presents the history and philosophy of this timeless health practice. </b></p><p>Much of what is known as yoga today emphasizes physical postures and exercises to increase flexibility and help relaxation.

It was the only explanation for the fact I hadn&#x2019;t been able to cry one single tear. I hadn&#x2019;t even squeezed out one fake tear at Mrs. Williams&#x2019;s funeral. I knew the church people thought I was evil. I could see it when they looked at me. But they had all gotten to witness it firsthand when they&#x2019;d watched me not show one small streak of emotion when I&#x2019;d stood beside Pastor Williams as they&#x2019;d lowered his wife into the ground. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor only five months ago. It had been stage five, and there had been nothing they could have done.<br> <br>The congregation had stopped by to check on her daily, and the parsonage had been flooded with casseroles, pies, and flowers. I had been told to stay out of sight. I&#x2019;d only upset her. Pastor Williams had been kind when he&#x2019;d instructed me to keep to my room when I&#x2019;d come home from school, but it&#x2019;d still stung. I&#x2019;d waited until I was sure they were asleep most nights to sneak downstairs and fix me something to eat for dinner. The endless supply of food had made it easy.<br> <br>When she had finally taken her last breath, the hospice nurse had come and knocked on my door to inform me. I had been asked to call Pastor Williams at the church and have him come home. I hadn&#x2019;t felt anything. Not one emotion from the news. I&#x2019;d realized then that she had been right all those years. I was evil. Only someone truly evil could be so indifferent to death. Mrs. Williams had been only fifty-four. But then, that was much older than my mother had been when she&#x2019;d died&#x2014;she had been only twenty.<br> <br>That was all behind me now. That life was over and in my past.<br> <br>I stood outside the apartment building that overlooked the Alabama gulf coast and let it sink in that this was now my home. I was far away from the life I&#x2019;d lived in South Carolina. I would have a new life here. One where I could sit and write my stories and attend the community college.<br> <br>Pastor Williams had wanted to get rid of me. I was thankful for that because I needed a way to get free from that place. He had called a friend of his and had gotten me into a community college ten hours away from the town full of people who hated me. He had bought me an apartment on the beach and even managed to get me a job working as a church secretary. He had a friend who pastored a church in Sea Breeze, Alabama. It was one of the reasons he had sent me here. He had had someone help set me up while he remained in South Carolina.<br> <br>I had heard Pastor Williams on the phone explaining to the man who would be my boss that I wasn&#x2019;t good with people and I was sheltered. Which wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. I had gone to an all-girl Christian academy, and everyone there had pretended that I hadn&#x2019;t existed. It wasn&#x2019;t my fault their mommas had told them about the evil inside me. I had never had a chance to actually be around people who wanted anything to do with me.<br> <br>Before I took my boxes out of the truck, I wanted to check out the apartment. Pastor Williams had given me a truck, too. Grabbing my purse and the keys he had placed in an envelope, along with one thousand dollars in cash, I jumped down out of the old truck and headed for the stairs. None of the apartments were on the street level. They were all on stilts above the ground. I figured this was for times when the water got high&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or during hurricanes. I wasn&#x2019;t going to think about hurricanes. Not now.<br> <br>I slipped the key into the lock and turned before pushing the door open. It swung wide, and I took in the pretty pale yellow walls and white wicker furniture. It was all very coastal. I loved it.<br> <br>Smiling, I walked inside and spun around in a circle with my arms opened wide. I tilted my head back and closed my eyes and let myself bask in the solitude. No one knew me here. I wasn&#x2019;t the evil girl who the pastor was stuck taking care of. I was just me. Blythe Denton. And I was a writer. A recluse eccentric writer who didn&#x2019;t care what she looked like. It didn&#x2019;t matter. She was free.<br> <br>Loud male voices laughing and throwing insults in the hallway interrupted my quiet moment of joy. I dropped my arms to turn and lock gazes with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a guy. Blue. Like the sky on a clear sunny day. That was all I could focus on. I had never seen eyes so blue. They were so startling, they were almost breathtaking. His friends&#x2019; voices were fading away, but he was still standing there. Then I noticed it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Was he wearing black eyeliner? I dropped my eyes to take in the rest of him.<br> <br>The pierced eyebrow and colorful tattooed skin I saw covering his arms had me jerking my gaze back up to his face. Seemingly windblown platinum-blond hair finished the wild look.<br> <br>&#x201c;You done, love? Or is it my turn?&#x201d; The teasing lilt to his low husky voice reminded me of warm chocolate. It made me feel almost giddy.<br> <br>Not sure what he was talking about, I looked back at his amused eyes. &#x201c;I, uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I what? I didn&#x2019;t know what to say. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you mean,&#x201d; I finally told him honestly. Should I apologize for staring at him? Had I been?<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you done checking me out? Because I&#x2019;d hate to interrupt you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh. My face heated, and I knew my cheeks were bright red. What was I thinking, leaving my door open for the world to see me? I wasn&#x2019;t used to this. Keeping my distance from men in general made me extremely inept at talking to one. However, this one didn&#x2019;t stare at me with that leer that made me nervous. I was used to the look men gave me because they thought I would do bad things with them. The ugly they saw didn&#x2019;t seem to deter them from wanting to see if I was as evil as they had heard.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just some tattoos and a couple piercings, love. I promise I&#x2019;m harmless,&#x201d; he said this time with a smile on his face.<br> <br>I managed to nod. I should say something. I just wasn&#x2019;t sure what to say. He was waiting on me to speak. &#x201c;I like them,&#x201d; I blurted out nervously. That sounded stupid. He raised an eyebrow, and a smirk touched his lips. &#x201c;The tattoos&#x2014;they&#x2019;re nice. Colorful. Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I sounded like an idiot. There was no saving myself from this disaster. Closing my eyes so I didn&#x2019;t have to see those blue eyes watching me, I took a deep breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not good at talking to people&#x2014;guys, people, anyone really.&#x201d; Had I really just told him that?<br> <br>If he would just turn and leave, then we could forget this moment forever. I forced my eyes open and caught him studying me with that grin still on his lips. He was going to think I was nuts. Maybe he was visiting someone here and didn&#x2019;t live in this complex. I really didn&#x2019;t want to face him again. Ever.<br> <br>He pressed the pad of his thumb to his bottom lip and bit the tip of it before chuckling and shaking his head. &#x201c;Not sure I&#x2019;ve met anyone quite like you,&#x201d; he said before letting his hand fall back down to his side.<br> <br>I was positive he hadn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Krit, dude.&#x201d; a male voice called down loudly from what sounded like the second floor. &#x201c;We got, like, thirty minutes until we gotta be there. Go fucking shower and change.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he muttered, glancing down at his phone as he pulled it out of his pocket. &#x201c;Gotta go. But I&#x2019;ll see you around, little dancer,&#x201d; he said with a wink, then stepped back out of the doorway and walked down the hall.<br> <br>Little dancer? Oh. I covered my face with both hands. He had seen me spinning around like an idiot. I sure hoped I didn&#x2019;t see him again. I just wanted to live life without drawing attention to myself. I was leaving that life&#x2014;the one where people saw me and huddled together while laughing and glancing at me&#x2014;behind. I didn&#x2019;t want to give anyone here ammunition to make fun of me. Being invisible couldn&#x2019;t be that hard.<br> <br>Unless you try to talk to guys, genius, I thought to myself. Walking over to the door, I closed and locked it. Next time I wanted to do something like spin in circles, I needed to close my door first.<br> KRIT<p></p> <br>Tonight we had a gig at Live Bay. It was a club in town that drew both tourists and locals. We had become a crowd favorite over the past two years, so the three nights a week we played at the club equaled four hundred and fifty dollars for each of us. Live Bay, along with the bar we played at an hour away in Florida, and another club in Mobile, Alabama, both weekly gigs, allowed each of us to clear over a grand a week just performing.<br> <br>Green, my best friend and bass guitar in our band, Jackdown, and I shared an apartment. However, we always had people crashing there. We were a family. We had been since we started this thing. Other than my older sister, Trisha, I hadn&#x2019;t had family, really. Our home life had sucked growing up. Now Trisha had her husband, Rock, and the three kids they&#x2019;d adopted. She managed to make it most Thursday nights to listen to me play, but that was it now. Used to be that she wouldn&#x2019;t miss even one of my shows.<br> <br>I got it though. I was good with it. She finally had the family she&#x2019;d always wanted, and she was happy. That was enough. She was a damn good mom, and those kids were lucky she was theirs now.<br> <br>We had a good show even though Trish wasn&#x2019;t there. But the redhead I&#x2019;d decided to bring home that night was tugging on my arm, needing attention. I hadn&#x2019;t had enough to drink, and I was lost in my thoughts instead of focusing on her tits, she so wanted me to notice her. I&#x2019;d noticed already. It was one of the reasons she was going back to my place.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re ignoring me,&#x201d; the girl pouted, sticking out her lips, where were painted a deep red. I liked red lips. Another reason she was with me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy there. He has an easy trigger after a gig,&#x201d; Green called back to us from the driver&#x2019;s seat. He knew how annoyed I could get with clingy needy girls. I just wanted them willing and easy.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just making sure he hasn&#x2019;t changed his mind,&#x201d; the girl replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;When I change my mind, love, you&#x2019;ll know it,&#x201d; I told her, then leaned down to take a taste of her red lips. They had the flavor of the candy she had been sucking on earlier, and beer. It was a good taste. I wanted a little more.<br> <br>Green chuckled from the front seat as the car came to a stop. &#x201c;See, he&#x2019;s all fun and games if you just let him be,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>I broke the kiss and got out of the car. I was ready for a drink and some music. And a lot of people. I needed the crowd. &#x201c;They all coming?&#x201d; I asked Green as I held out my hand for the girl to take. She quickly scrambled out of the car and clung to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably already here,&#x201d; he replied. The band liked crashing at our place on nights we played at Live Bay. We kept an open door for any neighbors. Seeing as they were all college students, they never complained. They came and joined the party.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; I asked the girl on my arm.<br> <br>I glanced down at her to see the pinched frown on her lips. She&#x2019;d told me earlier, but I hadn&#x2019;t cared then. I hadn&#x2019;t been sure I&#x2019;d be spending the night with her yet. Now I wanted to know. I didn&#x2019;t fuck a girl if I didn&#x2019;t know her name.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jasmine,&#x201d; she replied, then flipped her red hair over her shoulder.<br> <br>Jasmine seemed to have a bit of a temper with that red hair of hers. Normally, I was amused but not tonight. I was moody.<br> <br>The music was already going when we started up the stairs. There was no doubt it was coming from our apartment. Matty, our drummer, always grabbed a girl or three quickly and left the club after we finished our gig. But most of the time he got to the apartment first if his females didn&#x2019;t slow him down.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like the party has already started. I&#x2019;m gonna step out early and go find somewhere to study,&#x201d; Green said as he slowed to walk beside me.<br> <br>Green was almost done with law school. He would be taking the bar exam in six months. I was proud of him, but I also knew things would be changing soon. He wasn&#x2019;t going to be able to pursue law and live like we were living. He rarely stayed for the parties. He always escaped to go study. Eventually I would lose him, but I wanted him to succeed.<br> <br>&#x201c;We should move the parties to Matty&#x2019;s from now on,&#x201d; I said, feeling guilty that Green had to leave his place to be able to study.<br> <br>Green shook his head. &#x201c;Hell, no. The dipshit doesn&#x2019;t ever clean up, and his apartment is tiny as fuck. Besides, let&#x2019;s not mess with a good thing. I&#x2019;ve made it this far doing it this way. It works.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since we&#x2019;d been kids, Green had been the smart one. The one who always sacrificed. He made things happen. But somehow I had always been the one in the spotlight. Didn&#x2019;t really seem fair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just say the word when you want to change that,&#x201d; I told him, then glanced over at the closed apartment door we were passing.<br> <br>A smile tugged on the corner of my lips. Damn, that girl had been adorable twirling around her apartment. I had never seen such long thick hair that was so dark, it was almost black. Then those eyes of hers had been fucking amazing. I wasn&#x2019;t even sure what color they were exactly. They looked like they were hazel, but they reminded me of jewels. They&#x2019;d been startling at first.<br> <br>Although she had been wearing baggy-ass sweats and an even larger T-shirt, I could see the curves underneath. Sucked that I was only going to have to imagine what they actually looked like because I wasn&#x2019;t touching that. The innocence pouring off that girl was thick. She had barely been able to form words to talk to me.<br> <br>Fucking adorable was what it had been. And I didn&#x2019;t do adorable. Ever.<br> <br>Jasmine&#x2019;s hand slid down over my jeans and cupped my balls. &#x201c;I like to suck,&#x201d; she whispered in my ear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. You can show me how much as soon as we get in the room,&#x201d; I told her, and reached around to cup her ass.<br> <br>That had been all the reassurance she needed apparently, because she started unbuttoning my jeans before we reached the door to my apartment. Green turned back to say something to me and saw her hand busy at work with my jeans. He laughed and rolled his eyes then walked into our apartment, which was already full of several of the guys who lived around us, and a few locals who we partied with regularly. Of course, there were plenty of girls. Just in case Jasmine didn&#x2019;t work out.</p><h2>Tropics of Chaos</h2><p>From Africa to Asia and Latin America, the era of climate wars has begun. Extreme weather is breeding banditry, humanitarian crisis, and state failure. <p>In <i>Tropic of Chaos</i>, investigative journalist Christian Parenti travels along the front lines of this gathering catastrophe--the belt of economically and politically battered postcolonial nations and war zones girding the planet's midlatitudes. Here he finds failed states amid climatic disasters. But he also reveals the unsettling presence of Western military forces and explains how they see an opportunity in the crisis to prepare for open-ended global counterinsurgency. </p><p>Parenti argues that this incipient "climate fascism"--a political hardening of wealthy states-- is bound to fail. The struggling states of the developing world cannot be allowed to collapse, as they will take other nations down as well. Instead, we must work to meet the challenge of climate-driven violence with a very different set of sustainable economic and development policies.</p></p><p><b>Christian Parenti</b> is a contributing editor at the <i>Nation</i>. The author of <i>Lockdown America</i>, <i>The Soft Cage</i>, and <i>The Freedom</i>, he has written for <i>Fortune</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, <i>Conde Nast Traveler</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and the <i>London Review of Books</i>, among others. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>San Francisco Bay Guardian<br></b>&#x201c;Christian Parenti offers an unusual and compelling analysis of violence through the lens of the environment....Parenti also turns a sharp eye upon the repression, surveillance, and counterinsurgency that first-world nations have employed to combat growing violence in water-scarce, conflict-ridden regions, and calls for a more enlightened approach.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Jan McGirk, ChinaDialogue.net<br></b>&#x201c;<i>Tropic of Chaos</i> is a must-read. It telegraphs an urgent message of how quickly climate catastrophe is morphing around the globe.&#x201d;<br><b><br>Astra Taylor, Bookforum (online)</b><br>&#x201c;[A] harrowing tour-de-force... if you read one book on climate change this year (and really, who can bear to read more than one?), <i>Tropic of Chaos</i> should be it. The way you understand the changing climate, and the resulting conflicts that serrate our world, will be transformed.&#x201d;<b><br>Nomi Prins, Truthdig</b><br>&#x201c;Tropic of Chaos&#x201d; is a wake-up call to humanity, particularly to the richest nations (with the U.S. at the top of that list) that produce the greatest amount of carbon that accelerates climate change. The detrimental effects of our environmental gluttony at the heart of our economic avarice are not blurry fatalistic hypotheses&#x2014;they are here, today. As &#x201c;Tropic of Chaos&#x201d; illustrates so clearly, we can&#x2019;t afford, morally or economically, to be lax about the impact of catastrophic convergence on the global population or allow private profit-motivated interests to ruin civilization.&#x201d;<br><b><br>Foreign Policy In Focus</b><br>&#x201c;[An] impressive new book... If Naomi Klein, Mike Davis, and James Howard Kunstler had teamed up to write a book, the result would read something like <i>Tropic of Chaos</i>... <i>Tropic of Chaos</i> illustrates the strengths of merging climate projections with left historical analysis of the poverty and conflicts that define much of the Global South. The result is an important map key to the (possibly near) future, if not strictly a climate book. Viewing climate change as an amplifier of existing inequality and disorder results in a split-screen, one that deals as much with the last century as the current...there is no denying the relevance and immediacy of the book&#x2019;s main thesis, powerfully illustrated by the current drought-related famine in Somalia... <i>Tropic of Chaos</i> not only asks the right questions. An argument could be made that it deals with the only questions currently worth asking. Climate change is the X Factor lurking behind every other conversation over the direction and shape of our civilization. If the temperature goes up by the predicted six degrees Fahrenheit, Parenti is correct to conclude that all bets will most certainly be off.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br><b><br>Socialist Worker</b><br>&#x201c;[Parenti] has written a sweeping discourse on the collision set in motion between the natural and the social world...[Parenti&#x2019;s] book remains an important and cogently written, if frightening, contribution to our understanding of the planetary crisis and how we got here.&#x201d;<br><b><br>Social Funds</b><br>&#x201c;<i>Tropic of Chaos: Climate Change and the New Geography of Violence,</i> by Christian Parenti, is a rarity among nominally popular books, in that it seeks to describe what the world will look like if climate change is left unchecked.

On 22 April 1889, the American government opened the new Oklahoma Territory to settlement. In this volume, Lucky Luke acts as a government agent and ensures that every candidate for settlement is treated fairly. He has to deal with jealousy, corruption and greed.</p><p>Born and raised in Belgium, author Morris moved to the United States in 1946 for six years. There, he worked for MAD magazine and met Rene Goscinny, with whom he collaborated from 1955 until his own death in 1977. Goscinny also created the IznogoudA&#34; series with illustrator Tabary, published in English by Cinebook, and the hugely successful AsterixA&#34; series with illustrator Uderzo.Grade 8 Up In this installment, Luke is asked by the federal government to monitor the historic Oklahoma land grab with the help of the cavalry. Major events in the book parallel history the lineup on the territory line (as well as attempts by sooners to get in early), disputes over land, and the springing up of boomtowns peppered with the usual jokes and physical humor characteristic of the series. There is quite a lot of text that, plus references to actual events, makes Lucky Luke's adventures appropriate tie-ins to social-studies units as well as for leisure reading. New converts to the series will find plenty of volumes to keep themselves busy. <i>The Oklahoma Land Rush</i> was one of Goscinny's earlier entries in a run with artist Morris that would last nearly 30 years. Morris's art is distinctive his use of solid colors to draw attention to various features of a given panel is frequent and effective. Lucky Luke (and other characters) smokes cigarettes and cigars, and alcohol is used on occasion, and they blend in naturally in the stereotypical Old West environment. Fans of character-driven series like Tintin and Asterix will find much to like in Lucky Luke. <i>Jason M.

Yet as diverse as they seem, they share a common aim: the discovery of the essence of existence that can be found at the core of our being, and the liberation that comes from that discovery. With this worthy goal in mind, Richard Freeman presents an enlightening overview of the many teachings, practices, and scriptures that serve as the basis for all the schools of yoga&#x2014;hatha, bhakti, jnana, karma, tantra, and others. He shows how the myriad forms are ultimately related and can even be perceived to make up a vast, interpenetrating matrix, symbolizing the unity, profundity, and beauty of the ancient tradition.<br> To learn more, visit MirrorofYoga.com.</p><p>Richard Freeman has been a student of yoga since 1968.

For centuries, royal families have feared the gut-roiling, vomit-inducing agony of a little something added to their food or wine by an enemy. To avoid poison, they depended on tasters, unicorn horns, and antidotes tested on condemned prisoners. Servants licked the royal family&#x2019;s spoons, tried on their underpants and tested their chamber pots.</p><p> Ironically, royals terrified of poison were unknowingly poisoning themselves daily with their cosmetics, medications, and filthy living conditions. Women wore makeup made with mercury and lead. Men rubbed turds on their bald spots. Physicians prescribed mercury enemas, arsenic skin cream, drinks of lead filings, and potions of human fat and skull, fresh from the executioner. The most gorgeous palaces were little better than filthy latrines.

She jerked violently with a convulsion that seemed to start at her ankles and rippled viciously up through her entire body, ending with a fierce shuddering of her head and hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet Jesus,&#x201d; she exhorted, &#x201c;that was a big one!&#x201d; She took a deep breath, regaining herself. After a stunned moment, my doctor instincts kicked in.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, are you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>I had startled her, if that was possible given what I had just witnessed, and she gasped lightly. Then just as quickly she responded with radiant animation.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hi, sugar! I did not see you standing there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, do you need to sit down?&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled broadly and flipped her hand airily toward me. &#x201c;No, no, no, I&#x2019;m fine, sweetie. I was just having one of my moments.&#x201d; I gauged her to be about fifty and despite her robust size she had a lively, pretty face with near perfect chocolate brown skin. She wore no shortage of holiday-colored bracelets and beads and ornate earrings, all of which were adventurous by Watervalley standards but just short of gaudy. And despite her gushy delivery she spoke with a subtle articulation that wasn&#x2019;t the norm for around here. It had definitely been molded in an urban setting.</p><p>She reclaimed her wandering shopping cart and smiled warmly at me again, speaking with another quick gesture of her hand. &#x201c;You have a nice day!&#x201d; Then with an emphatic, cheery nod she proclaimed, &#x201c;Happy holidays,&#x201d; and was off.</p><p>I returned the smile and nodded cautiously. &#x201c;And you as well.&#x201d;</p><p>She continued at a leisurely pace down the aisle. I paused for a few moments to give her some distance. But after five or so steps, she once again halted and stood straight up at rigid attention with her entire body quaking and shuddering so violently that she rattled her grocery cart.</p><p>&#x201c;Sweet heavens!&#x201d; she announced in a loud voice.</p><p>I immediately left my own cart and dashed to her side. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, something&#x2019;s definitely not right here. I&#x2019;m a doctor. Are you having some kind of seizure?&#x201d;</p><p>She regained possession of herself, and regarded me with the same engaged, bright face. &#x201c;Goodness, sugar, are you Dr. Bradford? I have heard just so many wonderful things about you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yes, I am Luke Bradford, but right now, ma&#x2019;am, I&#x2019;m more concerned about you. You seem to be having some kind of neurologic episode. By chance are you epileptic?&#x201d;</p><p>She dipped her head, pursing her lips in an adoring smile. &#x201c;Listen to you. Aren&#x2019;t you just the sweetest? No, honey, I&#x2019;m not epileptic. It&#x2019;s just my silly pacemaker. Sometimes it gets a mind of its own and shocks me for no reason. It usually quits after two or three times. So I&#x2019;m fine, just fine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, if the ICD on your pacemaker is shocking you, it may mean that your heart is in a lethal rhythm. I think we need to get you over to the clinic.&#x201d; Numerous times in my brief medical career I had had to deal with patients in cardiac arrest. But the heroics needed to care for someone in remote Watervalley made this situation an absolute adrenaline shot. This lady needed critical medical attention, and fast.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s not necessary. I can tell when I&#x2019;m tachycardic because my hair tingles.&#x201d; She gave a light pat to her head and increased the wattage of her smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you may be right, but I still think it best to get you over to the clinic immediately. We have a pacemaker programmer and I can analyze yours in a matter of minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>She studied me for a brief moment with no break in her effervescent smile. Then she shrugged her shoulders. &#x201c;Dr. Bradford, it&#x2019;s really not necessary. But something tells me you&#x2019;re not giving up on this, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>I grinned, shaking my head.</p><p>She exhaled in resignation. &#x201c;Well, okay. If you insist. So look, I&#x2019;ve got four more things on my list. Let me just grab those and I can follow you over there.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood dumbfounded. Given the gravity of what was happening to her, this suggestion left me incredulous. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, I was actually considering calling the EMTs and having you taken to the clinic right away.&#x201d;</p><p>Once again she flipped her hand at me in dismissal. &#x201c;Oh, sugar, it is not worth that much trouble. Just let me grab these few items and I&#x2019;ll meet you in the parking lot.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite what I considered to be a potential disaster, it was clear that I was not going to win this part of the argument. I sought compromise. &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll help you round up what&#x2019;s left on your list and then you can ride with me over to the clinic.&#x201d;</p><p>She folded her arms, giving me a look of complete adoration. Her words began in a high pitch of inquiry and then descended lower. &#x201c;Really? You&#x2019;re willing to do that? Well, darling, if that&#x2019;s the case, then you may need to pucker up &#x2019;cause I might be laying a little bit of heaven on you.&#x201d;</p><p>I paused, slightly taken aback. &#x201c;Well, thanks. But I&#x2019;m sure that won&#x2019;t be necessary.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t certain what to make of that comment or of this incredibly colorful, unreserved woman. She was patently unconcerned and, admittedly, was showing no symptoms of cardiac distress. &#x201c;So, tell me what things you need,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>I collected the last few items on her list and met up with her in the checkout line. Wanting to move quickly, I grabbed her bags and headed for the door. But the woman had other ideas. Her top pace was more of a saunter and her jovial manner was a clear indicator that she saw no urgency in the situation. With pained effort I bridled my steps to keep even with her. Meanwhile, she was talking nonstop about how happy she was to be back in Watervalley, and about the warm day, and about starting a new business, and occasionally injecting some adoring commentary about how kind I was being. Truthfully, I felt more duty-bound than kind. As the only doctor in Watervalley, I knew full well that this woman&#x2019;s ill health was mine to deal with, either now or later.</p><p>Impatiently I walked toward my old Corolla. But as we neared, she spoke up. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s my car next to yours. Do you want to just take it?&#x201d; Beside my shabby Corolla was parked a late-model BMW with a license plate that read &#x201c;Bonbon1.&#x201d;</p><p>Driving her car threw too many variables in the mix, so I insisted that we take mine. I tossed her few bags of groceries into the backseat and opened the passenger door, only now realizing that my pocket-sized car might be an uncommonly awkward fit for a woman of her heft. To ease the process, I took her hand and arm to help her squeeze in. With some effort she maneuvered into the front seat and swung both feet inside.</p><p>I was just about to release her when a lightning bolt jolted me to attention and zipped up my arm. The world went black.</p><p>When I awoke, I was seeing double, lying with my back on the pavement and my face pointed skyward. The large woman was peering over me, but she had two faces. One was leering at me with scornful disdain while the other regarded me with a wide-eyed look of innocent anticipation. Then I realized I wasn&#x2019;t seeing double. Standing above me were none other than Connie Thompson, my devoted, critical, and&#x2014;ironically&#x2014;wealthy housekeeper, and beside her, the walking Christmas ornament lady from the grocery store. Against the clear blue midday December sky, they looked like twins.</p><p>I pushed myself to a sitting position and rubbed the back of my head where a considerable knot was rising.</p><p>Christmas ornament lady bent over and held my cheeks between her plump, fragrant hands. &#x201c;Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry. My silly pacemaker went off while you were holding my arm. The car tires insulated me, but the jolt must have grounded through you. You fell back and bumped your head on my Beemer.&#x201d;</p><p>Connie, on the other hand, peered at me sternly through her gold inlay glasses. She spoke in her typical expressionless, no-nonsense manner. &#x201c;Dr. Bradford, do you need medical attention?&#x201d;</p><p>I sat there for a moment with my arms crossed over my knees and eventually looked up again at the two women, one with the face of an eager puppy, the other with that of a disapproving schoolteacher. I pondered Connie&#x2019;s question and responded impassively, &#x201c;Yeah, looks like I have a lump on my head. What say you kiss it and make it better?&#x201d;</p><p>Connie rolled her eyes and regarded me with placid disdain. Her voice was absolute deadpan. &#x201c;Why am I not surprised that you would use even this situation to exhibit some foolishness?&#x201d;</p><p>I rose to my feet, rubbing the tender bump. &#x201c;How long was I out?&#x201d;</p><p>Christmas ornament lady responded, &#x201c;Only a couple of minutes. I called Connie immediately. Fortunately she was only a block away.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood for a moment, gazing back and forth at the two women. They were complete opposites in both manner and dress, but strangely, they looked similar.</p><p>&#x201c;So, you two know each other?&#x201d; I inquired.</p><p>This brought a shrug and giggle from the colorful one, while Connie tilted her head and regarded me with disbelief. &#x201c;Dr. Bradford, have you two not met?&#x201d; She exhaled with a tiresome frown. &#x201c;Then by all means, let me introduce you. Dr. Bradford, this is my younger sister, Estelle Pillow. You two have something in common. She got her doctorate from Vanderbilt also.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Connie drove her sister over to the clinic while I followed close behind in my Corolla. It probably wasn&#x2019;t the brightest idea for me to drive after receiving the bump to my head, but then again, it was only four blocks.</p><p>Set in the remote hills of Middle Tennessee, Watervalley was a quiet farming community that seemed to breathe the air of a different century&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a slower, more accommodating, more charitable time. I had arrived only six months earlier to serve as the town&#x2019;s new and only doctor. In return, Watervalley was paying off my med school debts, provided I set up practice for three years. Having grown up in Atlanta, I found that life here brought a whole new meaning to the concept of social adjustment. It had been a bumpy start, but the place had grown on me. And in return, well, I had grown on them. Watervalley had become home.</p><p>It was Thursday morning, two days after Christmas. Since the clinic staff was officially off for the holiday week, Connie unceremoniously offered assistance, speaking in a motherly blend of irritation and worry directed squarely at her sister. Seeing little harm in this, I had her follow along into the exam room in case help was needed. Besides, in the odd chance of an emergency, Clarence and Leonard, the Watervalley EMTs, were only a phone call away at the fire station. That is, if they hadn&#x2019;t become bored and slipped out to Fire Chief Ed Caswell&#x2019;s house to watch the Bowl games. Ed had a big screen.</p><p>With Estelle seated safely on the exam table I went about the methodic business of placing the leads and performing the pacemaker analysis. Connie hovered nearby, providing sharp-tongued commentary that escalated into a rapid-fire exchange between the two sisters, each strangely oblivious to the urgent medical matter at hand. Furthermore, they talked to each other in the third person, as if the other one was offstage in a soundproof booth.</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Bradford, I&#x2019;m truly sorry about my sister. She ought to have better sense than to be out shopping in her condition.&#x201d; Connie spoke with great authority, clearly treating this as an opportunity for a teachable moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, pay no attention to my sister, Dr. Bradford. I was actually surprised that she was out and about. Usually she turns to stone if sunlight hits her.&#x201d;</p><p>Connie was unfazed. &#x201c;You know, Dr. Bradford, I can&#x2019;t imagine anything sillier than someone coming to Watervalley to try to start a catering business, as if people can&#x2019;t cook for themselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bakery and catering business, Dr. Bradford. Everybody has a sweet tooth, including my sourpuss sister. Of course with her, it&#x2019;s just a working theory.&#x201d; Estelle was now wearing a subtle but superior smile.</p><p>Not missing a beat, Connie responded in a lilting, breezy voice, &#x201c;Well, when we&#x2019;re done here, Dr. Bradford, I&#x2019;ll need to take my sister to the Dollar Store to buy her some marbles because it&#x2019;s clear she&#x2019;s lost all of hers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Bradford, my sister forgets th...</p></p><h2>The SAS Self-Defense Handbook: A Complete Guide to Unarmed Combat Techniques</h2><p>Written by a former Survival Instructor of the SAS (Special Air Service - England&#39;s equivalent of the United States Special Forces), The SAS Self-Defense Handbook provides easy-to-follow illustrated instructions - for both men and women - on coping with all kinds of threatening situations, from muggings to knife attacks.

We are alienated not only from one another, but also from the land that sustains us. Our ecosystems are increasingly damaged, and human bodies are likewise degraded. Most of us have little understanding of how our energy is derived or our food is produced, and many of our current industrialized practices are both unhealthy for our bodies and unsustainable for the planet. Agriculturalist Fred Bahnson and theologian Norman Wirzba declare that in Christ, God reconciles all bodies into a peaceful, life-promoting relationship with one another. Because human beings are incarnated in material, bodily existence, we are necessarily interdependent with plants and animals, land and sea, heaven and earth. The good news is that redemption is cosmic, with implications for agriculture and ecology, from farm to dinner table. Bahnson and Wirzba describe communities that model cooperative practices of relational life, with local food production, eucharistic eating and delight in God&#39;s provision. Reconciling with the land is a rich framework for a new way of life. Read this book to start down the path to restoring shalom and experiencing Jesus&#39; kingdom of shared abundance, where neighbors are fed and all receive enough.</p><p><strong>Fred Bahnson</strong> is a permaculture gardener, a pioneer in church-supported agriculture, and an award-winning poet and essayist. He was a Kellogg Food Society policy fellow at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the cofounder and former director of Anathoth Community Garden in Cedar Grove, North Carolina. He is the author of <em>Soil and Sacrament</em> (forthcoming, Free Press)."Weaving personal stories with pertinent data, the authors call attention to biblical and theological mandates to care for all of God's creation, including the land. Written with a broad audience in mind and with a study guide for each chapter, this book is an excellent resource for churches, communities, and individuals committed to caring for, and reconciling themselves with, the land." (Narola Ao McFayden, Interpretation, 67(4))<br><br>"Books like this usually threaten us with scarcity. Bahnson and Wirzba beckon us with God's creative, 'abundant kingdom homesteading,' correcting our 'reconciliation deficit disorder' by helping us to see that the full scope of divine healing includes all creatures and the whole creation--soil and sea and air, and everything contained and sustained by them." (D. Brent Laytham, The Christian Century, May 1, 2013)<br><br>"This book was written to equip all of God's people to be more faithful ambassadors of reconciliation in regard to the land. . . . Many Christians need to learn again how to live sacramentally in 'God's garden.' This book provides the biblical vision along with down-to-earth examples that can help make this happen." (J. David Holland, Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith, Volume 65, Number 1, March 2013)<br><br>"Fred Bahson and Norman Wirzba are competent guides to this complicated, urgent subject. Too often, readers are hammered with statistics that, while true, tend to confuse and overwhelm. In this case, however, statistics are absolutely necessary and are used judiciously--in no small measure because of the high level of expertise of both authors." (John Nyquist, International Bulletin of Missionary Research, Vol. 36, No. 4)<br><br>Bahnson and Wirzba have written a book that is thoroughly Christian, offering inspiration to many of us who seek to understand what on earth (literally) God would have us do. But the book's apologetic value cannot be underestimated. It unfolds the riches of Christian teaching, tradition, experience, and reflection that makes it accessible to those outside the faith. They drive all of us to consider the actual ancient stumbling blocks of Jesus' humanity and his bodily resurrection, and they offer hope." (Rusty Pritchard, PRISM Magazine, September/October 2012)<br><br>"In Genesis, God entrusts the care of his good creation to humanity, commanding us to rule it as his vice-regents--which means careful stewardship, not consumeristic exploitation. Determining the difference between the two is sometimes difficult. But with the guidance of prayer, Scripture, and books life <em>Making Peace with the Land</em>, we might find the search for wisdom less difficult than we first thought." (Jake Meador, Christianity Today, June 2012)<br><br>"Without a doubt, our most anticipated book of the next few months. . . . This new collaborative effort promises to be an accessible introduction to both writers' work in defense of land, food and agriculture as essential to God's reconcilation, and should not be missed." (Chris Smith, Englewood Review of Books, Lent 2012)<br><br>"I cannot think of another book on making peace with the earth that does so much in so few pages--grounding its case with theological care, describing the causes of 'ecological amnesia' so clearly that they are impossible to disown and offering a vision of practical response that appeals to hope instead of guilt, and all of this while telling stories that make the book difficult to put down! Here is a book for anyone who is ready to trade ecological despair for practical action, in the company of two men who know what it means to be 'married to the land.'" (Barbara Brown Taylor, author of An Altar in the World)<br><br>"This series is on reconciliation, which is at the heart of the Christian faith. One of the early Christians said there are three dimensions to the cross--the vertical, which is about reconciliation with God; the horizontal, which is about reconciliation to other humans; and finally the cross is firmly planted into the earth, which calls us to reconcile with creation. That final dimension is perhaps the most neglected one of all in the piles of books on faith. I am deeply thankful for this addition to the library. We all just got smarter." (Shane Claiborne, author, activist and recovering sinner, www.thesimpleway.org)<br><br>"When Mary turned from the empty tomb and mistook Jesus for a gardener, it was no mistake: Jesus is the new Adam. Thank you, Fred and Norman, for reminding us of our Genesis 2:15 responsibility to tend and protect the Garden, this earth, and calling each of us to the good work of living peaceably with the land."

Visit her at SusanMallery.com."Returning to the scene of the crime?" Dellina Hopkins asked as she stared at the dark-haired man standing on her porch. She supposed the polite response to his presence was to invite him in. And she would...in a minute. But first she was going to make him work for it.<br><br>Sam Ridge, all six feet of dark-eyed, arrogant handsomeness, narrowed his gaze. "You're not going to make this easy, are you?" he asked.<br><br>Dellina smiled. "No. Would you, if you were me?"<br><br>He surprised her by flashing a grin. "No, I wouldn't."<br><br>"An honest man." She bumped the door open wider with her hip and stepped back to let him in. "It's a miracle."<br><br>He moved into the house. Dellina let the screen door slam into place, but left the thick wooden door open. It was summer in Fool's Gold, and plenty warm. The breeze would be nice. Plus&#x2014;and this was the part she would never admit to Sam&#x2014;having the door open meant they weren't totally <em>alone.</em> Okay, they were alone, but it didn't feel so intimate. And based on what had happened the last time they'd been together in this house, that was a good thing.<br><br>Sam paused in the middle of her living room, as if not sure where to go. His head turned slightly and she had a feeling he was glancing down the hall&#x2014;toward her bedroom. No doubt remembering what had happened some five months ago.<br><br>Dellina wanted to say it hadn't been her fault&#x2014;that everyone was allowed to be stupid on Valentine's Day. Or in her case, on Valentine's Day night. Only she had known exactly what she was doing and it had been as wonderful and disastrous as anyone could have imagined. Now both she and Sam were going to have to deal with the consequences.<br><br>He turned to face her, then motioned to the sofa. "We should probably have a seat."<br><br>"Will that make things easier for you?" she asked.<br><br>"If I say yes, will you sit?"<br><br>"Probably."<br><br>"Then yes. It makes things easier."<br><br>Dellina settled in one of the club chairs while Sam took the sofa.<br><br>He moved with controlled power. It was the former professional athlete thing, she thought, watching him sit down. At the risk of sounding like a groupie, she had firsthand knowledge that the man knew how to use his body. Of course, the last time she'd been in his presence, she hadn't been interested in sitting. Or talking. But then neither had he. They'd practically tumbled over each other in their race to her bedroom. He'd&#x2014;<br><br>Dellina pushed the very visceral memories away. Yes, Sam had been delicious in bed. But then things had gone downhill. She needed to remember what was important. He was here about a job. Not his unrequited lust for her. Based on how he'd been avoiding her for the past several months, when it came to her, he was plenty requited.<br><br>But he was also in a bit of a pickle.<br><br>The old-fashioned phrase made her want to smile. Yup, Sam needed her. Not in a delicious <em>take me now</em> kind of way, but for business. She was a party planner and he wanted to plan a really big business event. He was stuck and she was his way out. Sometimes, not often, but sometimes, circumstances went her way. So after five months of being able to ignore her and that single night, he'd been forced to face her. Was it so very wrong of her to enjoy the moment? She thought perhaps not.<br><br>She rested her hands flat on her thighs and looked at him. "How can I help you?"<br><br>His dark gaze settled on her face. "Really? You're not going to admit you know what any of this is about?"<br><br>She blinked deliberately, then opened her eyes wide. "When you made your appointment to speak with me, you didn't mention a subject." Of course she knew why he was here, but again, a little emotional torture seemed the right kind of payback.<br><br>A muscle twitched in his jaw. "All right. We'll play this your way. I'm Sam Ridge. I'm a partner at Score."<br><br>She grinned. "I know who you are, Sam. We don't have to pretend that much. Just tell me what you want and we'll move on from there."<br><br>He swore under his breath. "You're friends with Taryn. You've done work for her. How long are you going to punish me?"<br><br>He was right about Taryn. She and Dellina were friends and had worked together several times. Score, the PR firm in question, had moved to Fool's Gold just after the first of the year. Three of the partners were former NFL players and Taryn was the glue that held the company together.<br><br>"I haven't completely decided how long you should be punished," she admitted, wondering if batting her eyes again would be too over-the-top.<br><br>He sighed heavily. "Fine. We'll do this your way. Now that we've moved our business here, my partners and I want to have a big party for our clients. We've booked a hotel, but that's as far as the planning has gotten."<br><br>"A party," she breathed, and pressed her hand to her chest. "That sounds really nice."<br><br>In truth, being a neurosurgeon or the person who used to land the space shuttle probably made the top-ten list of jobs designed to give a person an ulcer. Sam would guess whoever was in charge of the ball dropping in Times Square on New Year's Eve probably had a few sleepless nights. But he would add that being a kicker for an NFL team had its moments of stress. When he'd been with the L.A. Stallions, he'd been responsible for twenty-six wins, including three during play-off games and one Super Bowl victory. He knew what it was like to have everyone watching him, both in person and on TV, and have his job performance critiqued endlessly.<br><br>He'd always known the outcome the instant his foot connected with the ball and he was famous for turning away and letting the sounds from the crowd tell him if he was right. He was used to pressure. He'd lived it and breathed it. But he'd never faced down anyone like Dellina Hopkins before, and the worst part about it was, she was right to give him a hard time.<br><br>Sam shook his head. "Okay," he said. "I give. I was wrong."<br><br>Her brown eyes twinkled. "Wrong about what?"<br><br>"That night. Leaving the way I did. It was just..." He motioned toward the hallway. "Those dresses and that list. All of it. I'm not looking to get married."<br><br>"Neither am I."<br><br>"You're the one with a room full of wedding gowns."<br><br>Her full lips pressed together. Sam tried not to notice, but her mouth was one of the first things that had caught his attention, back on Valentine's Day.<br><br>He'd been staying at Ronan's Lodge for a few weeks, until escrow closed on his new place. He'd gone down to the bar for a drink only to realize it was Valentine's Day and the place was crawling with couples. As he'd recently sworn off women&#x2014;again&#x2014;he'd started to turn around to go back to his room.<br><br>But before he could safely escape, he'd spotted Dellina. She'd been with friends. They were laughing and talking. No one had noticed him. She'd been pretty enough, but then she'd smiled and it was like getting kicked in the gut&#x2014;and he was a man who knew the power of a good kick. He'd sent over a tray of drinks for the table, they'd invited him to join them and an hour later he and Dellina had been having dinner together.<br><br>Later, when he'd kissed her, he'd discovered her mouth had been as exciting and intriguing as he'd hoped. She'd invited him home, he'd said yes and the rest had been incredible. Until he'd gotten up in the night and found himself in a nightmare.<br><br>He'd spent the past five months avoiding her. Tough to do in a town the size of Fool's Gold. The situation had been complicated by the fact that he'd enjoyed her company and had really wanted to see her again.<br><br>Now that his company needed her services, he'd been forced to suck it up. So here he was. Being tortured for sport. Kenny and Jack would point out there was no other reason to torment anyone.<br><br>Dellina rose. She was about five-five, with all the expected curves. When he saw her around&#x2014;because <em>wanting</em> to avoid her and being able to do it were two different things&#x2014;she was usually in dresses or suits. Today she had on jeans and a frilly sleeveless thing that shouldn't have been sexy and yet was. Looking at her bare arms made him remember the rest of her bare, which was what had led to the problem between them in the first place.<br><br>Damn, he should never have gotten out of bed today. Or moved to Fool's Gold. Or joined Score for that matter. Or been born.<br><br>"Stand up," she said.<br><br>He did.<br><br>She walked up to him and held out her hand. "We're starting over. I'm Dellina Hopkins. I own a party planning business."<br><br>He didn't know which tack she was taking now, but figured he didn't have a lot of choice in the matter. Time was ticking and he was desperate.<br><br>"Sam Ridge. My company is a PR firm."<br><br>They shook hands. The second her fingers closed around his he felt heat. His gaze immediately settled on her full lips and he remembered he hadn't had nearly enough time with them. Or any of her. It was just once she'd gotten naked, he hadn't been sure which part of her to enjoy first. Then the nightmare had started.<br><br>She withdrew her hand and dropped it to her side.<br><br>"Well, Sam, like many small businesses, mine is based in my home. This house I rent has three bedrooms. I sleep in one and I work out of one and that leaves a spare bedroom. Follow me, please."<br><br>She led the way down the hall. He hesitated. He had a good idea where they were going and it was not a place any man would want to revisit. What it came down to was how much he needed her. And he needed her a lot.<br><br>She paused outside a closed bedroom door. <em>The</em> closed bedroom door.<br><br>"So my friend Isabel owns a store in town called Paper Moon," Dellina told him. "She sells wedding gowns. Last fall she decided to expand the business to include other kinds of clothing. She leased the space next door and started remodeling. As you can imagine, it was a big project. Because of the construction, she lost some of her storage space. Now, the average wedding gown is a pretty special item. So when one stores them, one can't simply leave them anywhere. They need to be safe and temperature controlled."<br><br>The pieces were starting to fall into place. Sam remembered getting up after making love with Dellina. He'd still been shell-shocked by the heat they'd generated and very much looking forward to a second act. Only on the way back from the bathroom, he'd made a wrong turn. Instead of walking back into her bedroom, he'd found himself staring at what looked like rows and rows of wedding gowns.<br><br>Worse, on the wall had been a dryerase board with a header that read Ten Ways to Get Him to Propose.<br><br>He had, understandably, freaked. He'd found his way back to her room, pulled on his clothes and fled. From then until now, he hadn't spoken a word to Dellina. He'd avoided her, he'd avoided anything to do with her and he'd never allowed himself to think about that night. Because if he did, he would find himself wanting her again. And with his luck with women, it was important to stay with those who were completely sane.<br><br>Which it appeared Dellina just might be.<br><br>She opened the door. He instinctively stiffened and saw they were still there. Racks holding covered white gowns. Like plastic aliens, hanging and shrouded, waiting to be returned to the mother ship.<br><br>"Isabel pays me to store her dresses," Dellina said. "I would do it for free, but she insists on a small monthly payment. These are not my dresses."<br><br>"Okay." He tried to adjust his collar only to realize that his shirt wasn't buttoned all the way and any pressure he felt was the result of being an idiot.<br><br>He cleared his throat. "So, ah, that clears up the problem with the wedding dresses. What about that?"<br><br>He pointed to the dryerase board. It still stated Ten Ways to Get Him to Propose, but there weren't any suggestions by the numbers.<br><br>Dellina sighed and sagged back against the wall. "It's Fayrene."<br><br>He raised his eyebrows.<br><br>"My younger sister," she clarified. "Fayrene met Ryan last spring. They fell in love, but she didn't want to get married because she wanted to focus on her career. Ryan was fine with that and they agreed to wait four years."<br><br>"So what's the problem?"<br><br>"She's changed her mind and wants him to propose now."<br><br>He waited, knowing there had to be more.<br><br>"Ryan isn't getting the message." Dellina rubbed her temples. "Probably because she hasn't told him. Fayrene doesn't want to <em>tell</em> Ryan she's changed her mind. That wouldn't be romantic. She wants him to guess on his own."<br><br>"That's not going to happen," Sam told her. "If Ryan loves Fayrene, he's going to respect her wishes no matter how much he wants to get married sooner. This isn't a winning strategy."<br><br>"Thanks for your insight. I happen to agree with everything you've said, but unless you want to take that up with Fayrene, you're telling the wrong person. My point is, the list isn't about me."<br><br>Dellina faced him. "Look, Sam, I know you have no reason to believe me, but I don't bring home guys I just met. Ever. Last Valentine's Day was the first time I'd done anything like that."<br><br>She kept talking but he stopped listening long enough to revel in the fact that she'd picked him for her first one-night stand. Okay, it wasn't up there with curing a disease, but still, nice to know. He returned his attention to her.<br><br>"...and when you took off, I couldn't figure out what had happened. Then I remembered this room and I knew you'd freaked."<br><br>"Understandably," he added.<br><br>"Yes. It is a bit off-putting. But you could have asked me what was going on."<br><br>He thought about the other women who had been in his life. His family. If Dellina knew about all that, she wouldn't be expecting a rational response. But she didn't know any of it and he preferred it that way.<br><br>"You're right," he told her. "I should have asked. I reacted. It was late and we'd had sex and this room scared the hell out of me."<br><br>She smiled. "You run fast."<br><br>"I've had training."<br><br>Her smile widened, drawing his attention to her mouth. "You've done a good job avoiding me. Fool's Gold isn't that big."<br><br>"I noticed. You're in a lot of places. You didn't make it easy."<br><br>"I didn't want to," she admitted.<br><br>"Then you must have been happy to find out about the party."<br><br>Her expression turned impish. "A little."<br><br>Because getting the party together had fallen onto him. Normally he would have simply hired someone.<br><br>But the only party planner in town was Dellina. So he'd put off dealing with her as long as he could.<br><br>"Now that you've had your fun at my expense," he told her, "there's still a problem to solve."<br><br>"Right. Score is putting on a party for its best clients. Three days of fun and frolic."<br><br>"Frolic? Did you really just say that?"<br><br>She pushed off the wall and walked across the hall. "You know I did. Come on. Let's go talk about how much extra you're going to have to pay me to pull this all together in four weeks."</p><h2>The Year We Left Home: A Novel</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>The Year We Left Home </i>is National Book Award finalist Jean Thompson&#x2019;s mesmerizing, decades-spanning saga of one ordinary American family that captures the turbulent history of the country at large.</b><br><br>Named a <i>New York Times</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice, a <i>People</i> magazine &#x201c;Pick of the Week,&#x201d; and an Indie Next and Midwest Connections selection, <i>The Year We Left Home </i>is the career-defining novel that Jean Thompson&#x2019;s admirers have been waiting for: a sweeping and emotionally powerful story of a single American family during the tumultuous final decades of the twentieth century.<br> <br> Stretching from the early 1970s in the Iowa farmlands to suburban Chicago and across the map of contemporary America, <i>The Year We Left Home</i> follows the Erickson siblings as they confront prosperity and heartbreak, setbacks and triumphs, and seek their place in a country whose only constant seems to be breathtaking change.

This was for those of the bride&#x2019;s relatives who were stern about alcohol. The basement was low-ceilinged and smelled of metallic furnace heat. Old ladies wearing corsages sat on folding chairs, while other guests stood and managed their cake plates and plastic forks as best they could. The pastor smiled with professional benevolence. The bride and groom posed for pictures, buoyed by adrenaline and relief. There had been so much promised and prepared, and now everything had finally come to pass. </p><p>By five o&#x2019;clock the last of the crowd had retrieved their winter coats and boots from the cloakroom and headed out. It was January, with two weeks of hard-packed snow underfoot and more on the way, and most of them had long drives from Grenada, over country roads to get back home. The second reception was just beginning at the American Legion hall, where there would be a buffet supper, a bar, and a dance band. </p><p>The bride&#x2019;s younger brother had been sent to open the Legion building so that the food could be brought in ahead of time. He drove his pickup truck the mile from the church, playing the radio loud to shake off the strangeness of the day. He&#x2019;d been an usher at the wedding and he still wore his dark suit and blue-tinted carnation boutonniere, clothes that made him feel stiff and false. The whole import of the wedding embarrassed him powerfully, though he could not have said why. Many things had been disquieting: his sister in her overdone bridal makeup, his mother&#x2019;s weeping, the particular oppressiveness of anything that took place in church, the archness of the female relatives who told him how tall and handsome he looked. &#x201c;Pretty soon we&#x2019;ll get to dance at your wedding, hey?&#x201d; He&#x2019;d shrugged and said, Well, they could at least dance, which had made his girlfriend mad. </p><p>She was still back at the church and still mad, which was why he&#x2019;d managed to get away by himself, if only for a few minutes. As he was leaving, she&#x2019;d whispered that he should see what they had in the liquor cabinet over there. He guessed that that was what it was going to take to get her back in any kind of a good mood. A bottle they could show off as a trophy, then drink some night while they were out driving around. </p><p>The radio was playing &#x201c;Horse with No Name.&#x201d; He turned it up and sang along: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>I&#x2019;ve been through the desert on a horse with no name<br> It felt good to be out of the rain</i> </p></blockquote> <p>He wished he was out there right now, in some desert, instead of smack in the middle of his family, who, because they knew his origins and his history, thought they knew everything about him. He couldn&#x2019;t account for this feeling when a wedding, after all, was supposed to be this big happy thing. He guessed he must be some kind of freak. </p><p>The gray afternoon was already shutting down when he pulled into the Legion parking lot, got out, and fumbled with the stiff lock. It gave way and he stepped inside. </p><p>The hall was a big bare space with a much-buffed tile floor. Gloomy light reflected from it in pools. To one side was a kitchen with a large stainless steel double sink, two restaurant-style wall ovens, and a pass-through to the main part of the room. Long tables covered with white paper tablecloths were set up to receive food, and stools and hightops were stacked in the foyer. He tried the bar closet but as expected it locked with a separate key. Then he heard another car pull up. He turned on the overhead lights and went back out into the cold. </p><p>His Uncle Norm and Aunt Martha were unloading their station wagon. &#x201c;Ryan,&#x201d; his uncle said by way of a greeting, and handed him a foil-covered metal pan. &#x201c;Careful, this one&#x2019;s heavy.&#x201d; </p><p>His aunt said it had been a beautiful wedding, hadn&#x2019;t it, and Ryan said it had. That was the extent of the small talk since there was all the food to manage, work to be done, and with Norm and Martha, work came before everything else. There were a dozen or more big pans to carry inside, and two coolers, and a cardboard box full of paper towels and pot holders and other useful items. &#x201c;Just set everything out on the table,&#x201d; Martha directed, hanging up her coat and putting on the apron she&#x2019;d brought from home. Ryan, peeking under the foil, found sliced ham with raisin sauce, a macaroni-and-tomato casserole, a green salad, potatoes topped with shredded orange cheese, beef in gravy, chicken and biscuits, corn pudding. There were sheet cakes too, and bags of dinner rolls. </p><p>He guessed that Norm and Martha had organized the supper, collecting the prepared food from different country relatives. It would have been a very Norm-and-Martha thing to do. They were not, technically, his aunt and uncle. They were his grandmother&#x2019;s cousins, his mother&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s people. Tall, freckled, rawboned, they seemed not to have aged since his childhood. His mother had been a Tesman and her mother was a Peerson, and the Peersons were the scariest of the old Norwegian families. They lived out in the boondocks, what his dad called Jesus Lost His Shoes territory, and their church still held services in Norwegian the third Sunday of every month. Most of them farmed. They believed in backbreaking labor, followed by more labor, and in privation, thrift, cleanliness, and joyless charity. If you wanted a tree taken down or a truck winched out of a ditch or a quarter of a cow packaged for your meat locker, you called a Peerson. If you wanted lighthearted company, you called someone else. </p><p>The boy, Ryan, thought of them as part of some grim, old-country past that laid claim to him without his consent. Ever since he was a little kid he&#x2019;d heard instructive things about Norwegian this and Norwegian that, like postcards from a place he&#x2019;d never been and none of it any use to him, not flags nor fjords nor rotten jellied lutefisk, which nobody made anymore and nobody even pretended to like. Maybe if you poked around in the gene pool all the way back to the Vikings, you&#x2019;d find some worthy ancestor. But all that had been beaten out of people long ago, or maybe it was just that the tamest and most boring Norwegians had settled here in Iowa, where they devoted themselves to lives of piety and sacrifice and usefulness. </p><p>But he wasn&#x2019;t going to spend any more time thinking about all that, since what really counted was the life you made for yourself, and the person you decided to be. </p><p>Once the food was brought in, he and Norm began setting up the hightops and stools around the room&#x2019;s edges. He guessed it about killed Norm and Martha to be in a place where drinking would go on, but they saw it as their duty to be helpful, and both the duty and the disapproval would be part of the occasion for them. </p><p>&#x201c;So this fella,&#x201d; Norm began, and Ryan understood that Norm meant the groom, Ryan&#x2019;s new brother-in-law. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he like?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Jeff? He&#x2019;s OK.&#x201d; He was kind of an asshole. </p><p>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; Norm nodded, as if this was convincing information. He reached for a rag and slapped it across a tabletop. Norm&#x2019;s hands were big and chapped and had been gouged and nicked and scarred and healed over so many times that the skin was as full of history as an elephant&#x2019;s hide. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s he from, out West someplace?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. Denver.&#x201d; </p><p>Norm received this in silence. Ryan wondered what was bugging Norm about Jeff, who was your basic bullshit artist, all fake smiles and manly handshakes. You figured somebody that straight and narrow would be a hit with the home folks. But guess again. Ryan knew better than to ask any kind of direct question, so he kept on with his work, carting the stools and tables out into the room so Norm could place them in groupings. </p><p>Martha was busy running pans in and out of the warming ovens. The smell of the food was making him hungry. Pretty soon the band, or what passed for a band, would arrive to set up. It was just four guys from Ames in leather vests and striped shirts and some pitiful attempt at psychedelic effects generated by a strobe light. And then the guests would come, a mix of his sister&#x2019;s friends and Jeff&#x2019;s, and any of the local invitees who wouldn&#x2019;t miss the chance for free food and drink. His girlfriend too, though he hadn&#x2019;t been thinking about her until now and he guessed that was one more thing he&#x2019;d done wrong without even trying. </p><p>The tables were in place. Norm went to the front door and peered out. &#x201c;No snow yet. I don&#x2019;t suppose we&#x2019;ll stay that lucky.&#x201d; </p><p>Ryan, looking out from behind Norm&#x2019;s angular shoulder, saw the gray gauze sky and a pink sunset behind it glowing like a lamp. House lights were beginning to come on along the street, small and bright, and Ryan registered that the scene was beautiful, without thinking the word itself. &#x201c;Yeah, I guess it&#x2019;s supposed to start in later.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;June&#x2019;s best for weddings,&#x201d; Norm said, sounding unexpectedly decisive. &#x201c;Then you can have your flowers and your pretty weather. They didn&#x2019;t want to wait for June, hah?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I think this was the only time Jeff could get off, you know, for the honeymoon.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sure.&#x201d; Norm nodded and, turning away, gave Ryan a look he couldn&#x2019;t read, or maybe he was just imagining it in the light reflecting off Norm&#x2019;s eyeglasses. Embarrassment? Apology? It came to him that Norm thought his sister might be pregnant, and this was one of those hurry-up weddings. Oh, please. His sister Anita would probably still be a virgin three years after her wedding night because it would take that long for the industrial glue that held her legs together to wear off. But it was a weird thing to have to think about, o...</p></p><h2>Psychoanalysis: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Since its inception, psychoanalysis has been hailed as a revolutionary theory of how the mind works, whilst some of its ideas such as the Oedipus complex have become part of everyday conversation. In <em>Psychoanalysis: A Very Short Introduction</em>, Daniel Pick offers a lucid, lively, and wide-ranging survey of psychoanalysis. This book offers the reader a flavour of what it might be like to enter treatment, and suggests the possible surprises that can await both analyst and patient, as well as the potential benefits. <br><br>Yet whilst Freud's writings have shaped the way many of us understand dreams, desires, and destructiveness, as well as anxieties, blunders, and guilt, numerous critics have warned of the dangerous methods and time-bound assumptions of psychoanalysis, doubted the efficacy of its drawn-out methods, and dismissed its core claims as pseudo-science. Looking at modern ideas of the self, exploring the nature of unconscious aspects of relationships, and considering how psychoanalysis has evolved, Pick ponders the particular challenges now facing the analytic profession, and shows why psychoanalysis remains an important resource for investigating the mind, its creative functioning and many afflictions.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind represents an important breakthrough: in simple language, it presents complicated ideas and concepts in an accessible manner, demystifies psychoanalysis, debunks some of the myths that have plagued it, and defuses the controversies that have too long attended it. The author effectively demonstrates that the psychoanalytic model of the mind is consistent with a brain-based approach. Even in patients whose mental illness has a predominantly biological basis, psychological factors contribute to the onset, expression, and course of the illness. For this reason, treatments that focus exclusively on symptoms are not effective in sustaining change. The psychoanalytic model provides clinicians with the framework to understand each patient as a unique psychological being. The book is rich in descriptive detail yet pragmatic in its approach, offering many features and benefits: * In addition to providing the theoretical scaffolding for psychodynamic psychotherapy, the book emphasizes the critical importance of forging a strong treatment alliance, which requires understanding the transference and countertransference reactions that either disrupt or strengthen the clinician-patient bond.* The book is respectful of Freud without being reverential; it considers his contribution as founder of psychoanalysis in the context of the historical and conceptual evolution of the field.* The final section is devoted to learning to use the psychoanalytic model and exploring how it can be integrated with existing models of the mind.* In addition to being a valuable reference for mental health clinicians, the text can serve as a resource for undergraduate and graduate students of philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, literature, and all academic disciplines outside of the mental health professions who may want to learn more about what psychoanalysts have to say about the mind.* Important features include an extensive glossary of terms, a series of illustrative tables, and appendixes addressing libido theory and defenses. Drawing upon a broad range of sources to make her case, the author persuasively argues that the basic tenets of the psychoanalytic model of the mind are supported by empirical evidence as well as clinical efficacy. The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind is a fascinating exploration of this complex model of mental functioning, and both clinicians and students of the mind will find it comprehensive and riveting.</p><p><p>Written for students at every level of training, including psychiatry residents, psychology graduate students, social work students, and medical students, The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind explains how the psychoanalytic model works and how it contributes to the care of people with mental illness. The book is founded on the psychoanalytic thinking that evolved over the last 120 years and surveys how the psychoanalytic model has become the basis for almost all psychological treatments, or "talking cures," for emotional suffering.</p><p>In plain and accessible language, the author outlines the history of psychoanalysis, answers basic questions, defines the core dimensions of psychodynamic models, and illustrates their clinical utility. The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind explores the most complex model of mental functioning ever formulated for clinical purposes and demonstrates that this model is useful in treating all patients, all of the time.</p>Elizabeth L.

This problem has deep philosophical implications: If languages are all the same, it implies a fundamental commonality--and thus mutual intelligibility--of human thought.We are now on the verge of solving this problem. Using a twenty-year-old theory proposed by the world&#39;s greatest living linguist, Noam Chomsky, researchers have found that the similarities among languages are more profound than the differences. Languages whose grammars seem completely incompatible may in fact be structurally almost identical, except for a difference in one simple rule. The discovery of these rules and how they may vary promises to yield a linguistic equivalent of the Periodic Table of the Elements: a single framework by which we can understand the fundamental structure of all human language. This is a landmark breakthrough both within linguistics, which will herewith finally become a full-fledged science, and in our understanding of the human mind.</p><p><b>Mark C. Baker</b> is a professor in the Department of Linguistics and the Center for Cognitive Science at Rutgers University. He lives in Camden, New Jersey.Rutgers University linguist Baker delivers a milestone in the field of linguistics. In fact, the book goes far in establishing linguistics as a hard science. But before diving into linguistic jargon, Baker engagingly describes the success of the Navajo Code Talkers during WWII; their language proved the one cipher that eluded Japanese cryptographers. While most people would consider words the components of language a lexical rather than a grammatical issue Baker explores the "parametric theory" posited by, among others, Noam Chomsky, which cites grammatical structure or "parameters as the atoms of linguistic diversity." Many linguists find these parameters "recipes" for how words are put together to form meaning a satisfactory explanation for both the similarities and the differences between languages of completely different origins. English and Edo (West African), for example, are grammatically closer than English and French. Baker and others do not believe that word-order formulae stem from either cultural factors or "the survival dynamics of evolutionary biology." He doesn't, however, deny the cultural implications of language: numerous parameters prevented Napoleonic French, for example, from dominating Europe. Certain issues have weak explanations, such as the reasons that various Latinate languages developed divergent parameters. The concluding, somewhat indirect discussion of "hints of what parameters are related to" feels like a push for page count. Though Baker's comparison between linguistics and chemistry i.e., between the detection of grammatical "recipes" and chemists' long struggle to establish the periodic table may seem extreme to some, his clarification of complicated linguistics theories is more accessible than most. Sadly, few Americans care about word order (even in English), so this significant book may only get attention from specialists and libraries. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Stars Down to Earth (Routledge Classics)</h2><p><em>The Stars Down to Earth</em> shows us a stunningly prescient Adorno. Haunted by the ugly side of American culture industries he used the different angles provided by each of these three essays to showcase the dangers inherent in modern obsessions with consumption. He engages with some of his most enduring themes in this seminal collection, focusing on the irrational in mass culture - from astrology to new age cults, from anti-semitism to the power of neo-fascist propaganda. He points out that the modern state and market forces serve the interest of capital in its basic form. Stephan Crook's introduction grounds Adorno's arguments firmly in the present where extreme religious and political organizations are commonplace - so commonplace in fact that often we deem them unworthy of our attention. Half a century ago Theodore Adorno not only recognised the dangers, but proclaimed them loudly. We did not listen then.

John Behr sets Irenaeus both within his own context of the second century, a fundamental period for the formation of Christian identity, elaborating the distinction between orthodoxy and heresy and expounding a comprehensive theological vision, and also within our own contemporary context, in which these issues are very much alive again. Against the commonly-held position that 'orthodoxy' was established by excluding others, the 'heretics', Behr argues that it was the self-chosen separation of the heretics that provided the occasion for those who remained together to clarify the lineaments of their faith in a church that was catholic by virtue of embracing different voices in a symphony of many voices and whose chief architect was Irenaeus, who, as befits his name, urged peace and toleration.<br>The first chapter explores Irenaeus' background in Asia Minor, as a disciple of Polycarp of Smyrna, his activity in Gaul, and his involvement with the Christian communities in Rome. The theological and institutional significance of his interventions is made clear by tracing the coalescence of the initially fractionated communities in Rome into a united body over the first two centuries.<br>The second chapter provides a full examination of Irenaeus' surviving writings, concentrating especially on the literary and rhetorical structure of his five books <em>Against the Heresies</em>, his 'refutation and overthrowal' of his opponents in the first two books, and his establishing a framework for articulating orthodoxy.<br>The final chapter explores the theological vision of Irenaeus itself, on its own terms rather than the categories of later dogmatic theology, grounded in an apostolic reading of Scripture and presenting a vibrant and vigorous account of the diachronic and synchronic economy or plan of God, seen through the work of Christ which reveals how the Hands of God have been at work from the beginning, fashioning the creature, made from mud and animated with a breath of life, into his own image and likeness, vivified by the Holy Spirit, to become a 'living human being, the glory of God'.<br></p><p><br><strong>Fr. John Behr</strong> is the Dean of St Vladimir's Seminary and Professor of Patristics, teaching courses in patristics, dogmatics and scriptural exegesis at the seminary, and also at Fordham University, where he is the Distinguished Lecturer in Patristics. He is also Metropolitan Kallistos Chair in Orthodox Theology at Vrije Universiteit. Before becoming Dean in 2007, he served as the editor of St Vladimir's Theological Quarterly, and he still edits the Popular Patristics Series for SVS Press.<br>His early work was on issues of asceticism and anthropology, focusing on St. Irenaeus of Lyons and Clement of Alexandria. After spending almost a decade in the second century, Fr John began the publication of a series on the Formation of Christian Theology, and has now reached the fifth and sixth centuries. He has recently completed an edition and translation of, and introduction to, the remaining texts of Diodore of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia. He has also published a synthetic presentation of the theology of the early centuries, focused on the mystery of Christ.<br><br>"...[I]n his usual lucid and succinct manner, B. organizes in a modest three chapters a volume that is profoundly researched and the product of mature thought about Irenaeus and his theological legacy. It thus admirably meets the series's goals to produce 'well-researched yet accessible books.'" --<em>Theological Studies</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Pulled Over: How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship (Chicago Series in Law and Society)</h2><p><p>In sheer numbers, no form of government control comes close to the police stop. Each year, twelve percent of drivers in the United States are stopped by the police, and the figure is almost double among racial minorities. Police stops are among the most recognizable and frequently criticized incidences of racial profiling, but, while numerous studies have shown that minorities are pulled over at higher rates, none have examined how police stops have come to be both encouraged and institutionalized.</p> <p><br> <i>Pulled Over</i> deftly traces the strange history of the investigatory police stop, from its discredited beginning as &#x201c;aggressive patrolling&#x201d; to its current status as accepted institutional practice. Drawing on the richest study of police stops to date, the authors show that who is stopped and how they are treated convey powerful messages about citizenship and racial disparity in the United States. For African Americans, for instance, the experience of investigatory stops erodes the perceived legitimacy of police stops and of the police generally, leading to decreased trust in the police and less willingness to solicit police assistance or to self-censor in terms of clothing or where they drive. This holds true even when police are courteous and respectful throughout the encounters and follow seemingly colorblind institutional protocols. With a growing push in recent years to use local police in immigration efforts, Hispanics stand poised to share African Americans&#x2019; long experience of investigative stops.<br> </p> <p>In a country that celebrates democracy and racial equality, investigatory stops have a profound and deleterious effect on African American and other minority communities that merits serious reconsideration. <i>Pulled Over</i> offers practical recommendations on how reforms can protect the rights of citizens and still effectively combat crime.</p></p><p><b>Charles R.

Haider-Markel</b> is professor of political science at the University of Kansas.&#x201c;<i>Pulled Over</i> succeeds in providing convincing evidence&#x2014;the most exhaustive to date&#x2014;demonstrating how pernicious racism can be at an institutional level without anyone specifically intending that result and with the intention perhaps running in the opposite direction. This is significant research on a fundamental issue presented in a clear, exhaustive manner, and it takes our knowledge of policing a big step further, offering in the process a clear prescription for reform. The book should be of interest to everyone concerned about the way American institutions perpetuate racism.&#x201d;<br> (Doris Marie Provine, Arizona State University)<br><br>&#x201c;This timely volume uses a multifaceted empirical analysis which focuses on street stop experiences among white and minority respondents to examine a central and continuing issue within contemporary American policing. Combining a careful historical exploration of police policies and practices with the results of surveys and in-person interviews, Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel offer a sophisticated and illuminating examination of the experience of police stops. Their efforts identify an important distinction between traffic and investigatory stops and locate race-based problems with the latter type of experience. Polite and respectful police demeanor, while to some extent palliative, cannot assuage the damaging effects of the widespread and systematic use of this policing technique on the minority community. This is a very good read and a compelling inquiry into the impact of police actions on white and minority motorists." (Tom R. Tyler, Yale Law School)<br><br>&#x201c;A searing portrayal of the everyday indignities borne by African Americans in their routine encounters with the police on the nation&#x2019;s highway and streets. The authors expose the willful racial blindsight of police and the courts to the evolution of the &#x2018;investigatory stop&#x2019; from its modest role in fighting crime to a sharp-edged weapon that corrodes the citizenship and belonging of African Americans and Latinos. The harrowing narratives and careful statistical analysis leave little doubt that police stops on the highways are racially tinged with disrespect for citizens while signaling to them and us that minority drivers have little power or prospects for equal treatment before the law. <i>Pulled Over</i> shines light on the institutional norms where there is leverage for reform through respectful and lawful policing.&#x201d; (Jeffrey A. Fagan, Isidor and Seville Sulzbacher Professor of Law, Columbia Law School)<br><br>&#x201c;In recent decades, investigatory police stops have become a mainstay of American law enforcement. To my mind, <i>Pulled Over</i> is the definitive account of this development, but it is also far more than that. Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel have produced a masterly study of how state authority and citizenship are organized, racialized, and experienced in the United States today. I recommend the book most of all to those who&#x2019;ve grown tired of stale debates about whether the targeted policing of young black men is &#x201c;racist&#x201d; or &#x201c;rational.&#x201d; In these pages, you will find a richer perspective informed by careful statistical analysis and stories from both sides of the police stop. You will also find prose that is a pleasure to read and compelling reasons to believe that we can and must do better.&#x201d; (Joe Soss, University of Minnesota)<br><br>&#x201c;A valuable tool for teaching the cultural impact that law and police policies create, as well as providing a source for discussion when instructing on ethnographic research. As a means for explaining the premise of institutionalized racial framing and its history in US policing, the level of implementation, and the experiences of those to whom they are applied, this book is informative, thought provoking, and easily digested. . . . &nbsp;Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel provide a lasting impression of how investigative intrusions create and change society's shared expectation of racial stereotypes and damage interracial relationships on the ground. . . . Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i> 2014-10-21)<br><br>&#x201c;Based on my reading of <i>Pulled Over</i>, I now think of the choices involved in racial profiling (or, in policies deliberately chosen to avoid racial disparities in police stops) as representing a conflict <i>within</i> the police, a tradeoff between different aspects of controlling crime. Their data and analysis can be viewed as a case study, narrowly focused on traffic stops in a single metro area in one particular time period, but Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Harkel use the insights thus obtained to give a general sense of the ways in which racially disparate police policies can have apparent short-term utility while being counterproductive of the larger goals of policing.<i>&#x201d;</i> (<i>Criminal Law and Criminal Justice Books</i> 2014-10-28)<br><br>"A thoughtful, penetrating, and timely analysis of the causes, experiences, and effects of discriminatory police stops. . . . <i>Pulled Over</i> offers a corrective to a number of our existing accounts of racially inequitable police encounters. While the findings presented are troubling, it is not a fatalistic account. . . .

What is this enigma that we call <em>human</em>? Who are we? Since the dawn of human history, people have exhibited wildly contradictory qualities: good and evil, love and hate, strength and weakness, kindness and cruelty, aggressiveness and pacifism, generosity and greed, courage and cowardice. Experiencing a sense of eternity in our hearts--but at the same time confined to temporal and spatial constraints--we seek to understand ourselves, both individually and as a species. <br> In <em>Who Are We? Theories of Human Nature</em>, esteemed author Louis P. Pojman seeks to find answers to these questions by exploring major theories in Western philosophy and religion, along with several traditions in Eastern thought. The most comprehensive work of its kind, the volume opens with chapters on the Hebrew/Christian view of human nature and the contrasting classical Greek theories, outlining a dichotomy between faith and reason that loosely frames the rest of the book. The following chapters cover the medieval view, Hindu and Buddhist perspectives, conservative and liberal theories, Kant's Copernican revolution, Schopenhauer's pessimistic idealism, and Karl Marx's theory. Freud's psychoanalytic view, the existentialist perspective, the Darwinian view, and scientific materialism are also discussed. Pojman concludes with a discussion of the question of free will, ultimately asserting that each one of us must decide for ourselves who and what we are, and, based on that answer, how we shall live.<br></p><p>Louis P. Pojman is Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the United States Military Academy.</p><h2>The Soviet Union: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>The Soviet Union at its height occupied one sixth of the world's land mass, encompassed fifteen republics, and stretched across eleven different time zones. More than twice the size of the United States, it was the great threat of the Cold War until it suddenly collapsed in 1991. Now, almost twenty years after the dissolution of this vast empire, what are we to make of its existence? Was it a heroic experiment, an unmitigated disaster, or a viable if flawed response to the modern world? Taking a fresh approach to the study of the Soviet Union, this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> blends political history with an investigation into Soviet society and culture from 1917 to 1991. Stephen Lovell examines aspects of patriotism, political violence, poverty, and ideology, and provides answers to some of the big questions about the Soviet experience. Throughout, the book takes a refreshing thematic approach to the history of the Soviet Union and it provides an up-to-date consideration of the Soviet Union's impact and what we have learnt since its end.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

With expanded coverage of different models, along with new developments in evidence-based and postmodern practices, this integrative textbook bridges the gap between science and systemic/relational approaches, as it guides the reader through each stage of family therapy.</p> <p></p> <p>Part I lays the groundwork by introducing the first-, second-, and third-generation models of family therapy, teaching the reader to integrate different elements from these models into a systemic structure of practice. Part II explores the practical application of these models, including scripts for specific interventions and rich case examples that highlight how to effectively work with diverse client populations. Students will learn how to make connections between individual symptoms and cutting-edge family practices to respond successfully to cases of substance abuse, trauma, grief, depression, suicide risk, violence, LGBTQ families, and severely mentally ill clients and their families.

Renowned author, educator, and lean product development expert Ron Mascitelli takes the reader through his Event-Driven Lean Product Development process, from its beginnings in innovation, effective problem-solving, knowledge creation, and organizational learning, through to the rapid commercialization of highly successful products. This proven and practical approach balances all aspects of market success: customer value, profitability, time-to-market, and quality. Specific topics covered in this Event-Driven Lean Product Development framework include: - Selecting and prioritizing new product opportunities that have a high probability of market success. - Optimizing the productivity of finite development resources, and arbitrating resource conflicts in a multi-project environment. - Implementation of a practical, flexible, event-driven process that ensures the highest degree of cross-functional collaboration at every stage in new product development. - Managing the day-to-day efforts of developers and project teams through Visual Workflow Management. - Capturing the voice-of-the-customer in every new product by systematically identifying and ranking differentiation opportunities. - Building a realistic project schedule that is created and owned by the developers themselves. - Proactively identifying project risks and mitigating them through systematic (A3) problem-solving. - Employing rapid cycles of learning and set-based design to close knowledge gaps and build a foundation of high-value knowledge for future projects. - Implementing the Production Process Preparation (3P) methodology to maximize the manufacturability and quality of each new product. Mastering Lean Product Development represents the definitive roadmap to achieving breakthroughs in speed, efficiency, and customer value for any firm engaged in new product development.</p><p>Ronald Mascitelli, PMP (Project Management Professional, MS Solid-State Physics, UCLA) is the Founder and President of Technology Perspectives.

I have told many people that I truly believe that Ron's processes and tools help close the gaps that have always existed between the manufacturing &amp; engineering worlds! --Shawn Klinge - Lean Sensei<br><br>Working in a world with an ocean sized library of everything Lean, it is refreshing to apply Ron's methodology. These methods are centered around an intense focus on the 20% of the activities in the Lean library that translate to 80% of the benefits. Today's Lean methodologies range from simple waste elimination all the way to the microscopic analysis practices imbedded in Six Sigma, Statistical Process Control, and Total Quality Management. The genius in Ron's approach is its center around simplicity and pragmatism that helps transcend the reader to a holistic view of their business; all accomplished at realistic levels of resource investment. This simplicity drastically reduces barriers to entry when talking about macro-level shifts in a company's working culture. The overwhelmed glassy eyes in the class room shift to sparkling engagement while working with this methodology. I would recommend this approach for companies with little to no resources all the way to the 10,000 pound gorillas of industry, it just works. --Nick Phillips - Senior Design Engineer<br><br>Ron Mascitelli's real-world engineering experience, clear writing style, and pragmatic approach to the complex and multifaceted subject of Lean Product Development and Lean Product Design has helped our business accelerate the implementation of a robust New Product Introduction process.

The root of Sigmund Freud's approach to psychiatric treatment resides in bringing the id, the hidden source of human passion, to the surface. The ego&nbsp;&#x2014; formed to negotiate the id's interactions with reality &#x2014; and the superego &#x2014; the critical, moralistic part of the mind &#x2014; remain in constant conflict with the id's demands. <br>Although the concept of the unconscious was not Freud's own invention, he&nbsp;brought it into popular awareness and pioneered its use in treating mental conditions. This groundbreaking volume constitutes one of the Viennese physician's most insightful works on the topic. In addition to positing the balancing act between the id, ego, and superego, Freud further explores the concepts of the life force and the death force, and the anxieties driven by fear, morality, and guilt.</p><p>The Father of Psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (1856&#x2013;1939) ranks among the most important figures in Western psychology.

Her mother was a queen, her father an earl, and she herself was the granddaughter, niece, cousin, and grandmother of monarchs. Lady Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox, was an important figure in Tudor England, yet today, while her contemporaries&#x2014;Anne Boleyn, Mary, Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I&#x2014;have achieved celebrity status, she is largely forgotten. <br> &nbsp;<br> Margaret&#x2019;s life was steeped in intrigue, drama, and tragedy&#x2014;from her auspicious birth in 1530 to her parents&#x2019; bitter divorce, from her ill-fated love affairs to her appointment as lady-in-waiting for four of Henry&#x2019;s six wives. In an age when women were expected to stay out of the political arena, alluring and tempestuous Margaret helped orchestrate one of the most notorious marriages of the sixteenth century: that of her son Lord Darnley to Mary, Queen of Scots.&nbsp;Margaret defiantly warred with two queens&#x2014;Mary, and Elizabeth of England&#x2014;and was instrumental in securing the Stuart ascension to the throne of England for her grandson, James VI.<br> &nbsp;<br> The life of Margaret Douglas spans five reigns and provides many missing links between the Tudor and Stuart dynasties. Drawing on decades of research and myriad original sources&#x2014;including many of Margaret&#x2019;s surviving letters&#x2014;Alison Weir brings this captivating character out of the shadows and presents a strong, capable woman who operated effectively and fearlessly at the very highest levels of power.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Lost Tudor Princess</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;This is a substantial, detailed biography of a fascinating woman who lived her extraordinary life to the full, taking desperate chances for love and for ambition.

She lives in Surrey, England, with her husband.CHAPTER 1<br><br>&#x201c;A Fair Young Lady&#x201d;<br><br>Margaret Tudor was the eldest daughter of Henry VII, the first Tudor King of England, and his Queen, Elizabeth, heiress of the royal House of York. She had been born in November 1489 and was just thirteen when, in 1503, in the interest of forging good relations with Scotland, England&#x2019;s traditional enemy, she had been married to James IV, King of Scots, who was sixteen years her senior and renowned for his lechery. Four of their six children died in infancy, but in 1512 Margaret Tudor bore a son, also called James, who thrived.<br><br>However, the following year James IV invaded England, seeking to take advantage of Henry VIII&#x2019;s absence on a campaign in France. The English were not unprepared, however, and a large force under the command of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, marched north to confront James. The two armies met on September 9, 1513 at Flodden in North�umberland, and by the end of the day King James and the flower of the Scottish nobility lay slaughtered in the field. It was one of the most cataclysmic events in Scottish history, immortalized in ballads such as &#x201c;The Flowers of the Forest,&#x201d; in which it is claimed that twelve thousand were slain. Nearly every notable family lost at least one of its sons, and the impact of this disastrous defeat would be felt for generations.<br><br>Scotland was now under the nominal rule of an infant, James V, and subject to yet another long minority; such had been its fate for more than a century, as king after king had succeeded in childhood. It was a kingdom dominated by huge interrelated families, notably the Stewarts, the Douglases and the Hamiltons, and this age-�old clannish system of kinship groupings had nurtured a fierce sense of family. Allowed virtual autonomy during a succession of regencies, the factious Scottish nobility had come to enjoy great power and pursue deadly rivalries. Alliances and loyalties constantly shifted, and blood feuds could persist for centuries.<br><br>The great lords were all hungry for power, and it was rare for a widowed queen to be granted custody of her children; nevertheless Queen Margaret was named regent of Scotland during the minority of her son and given the guardianship of the young King and his infant brother. She had been newly pregnant when her husband was killed, and in April 1514, at Stirling Castle, she had borne another son, Alexander, Duke of Ross.<br><br>On August 6, 1514, less than a year after her husband&#x2019;s death, Margaret Tudor secretly married again without consulting the Scottish lords or her brother, Henry VIII. Her bridegroom was Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus&#x2014;�&#x201c;Ard,&#x201d; as he styled himself1&#x2014;�a member of her Council and the head of the faction that supported her rule. Handsome, charming, courteous and accomplished in chivalric exploits, he was the son of George Douglas, Master of Angus, and a widower, having lost his first wife, Margaret Hepburn, the year before. Angus, who at twenty-�six was the same age as his bride, was &#x201c;very lusty in the Queen&#x2019;s sight.&#x201d;2 He was a man of mild temper, dry humor and undoubted courage, and although his enemies saw him as treacherous, he was good at building and maintaining friendships. He was ambitious, wholly committed to the aggrandizement of his family, and hungry for power. Although this was a love match on Margaret Tudor&#x2019;s part, it was probably prompted more by self-�interest on Angus&#x2019;s.<br><br>The Douglas family was an ancient one and could trace its origins back to the Dark Ages. A William Douglas had fought for the Emperor Charlemagne, and Sir James Douglas had carried King Robert the Bruce&#x2019;s heart to the Holy Land; since then the arms of his descendants have borne a crowned heart. Their crest, which Margaret Douglas would also use, was the salamander. They were an ambitious tribe, into which Margaret&#x2019;s strong character fitted well, and &#x201c;family envies were strong,&#x201d;3 leading in 1380 to the clan splitting into two feuding branches, the senior being the Black Douglases and the junior the Red Douglases, to which line the Earls of Angus belonged.<br><br>The 5th Earl, Archibald &#x201c;Bell-�the-�Cat&#x201d; Douglas, the most powerful noble in the kingdom, had played traitor against King James IV in 1482, allying himself with Henry VII of England, but he was back in favor a decade later, having established the Douglases as the foremost family in Scotland. He had won his nickname&#x2014;�&#x201c;belling the cat&#x201d; means &#x201c;performing a challenging task&#x201d;&#x2014;�by getting rid of a royal favorite. But his son, George Douglas, Master of Angus, Margaret Douglas&#x2019;s grandfather, had perished at Flodden.<br><br>The history of the Douglas clan was a violent one; few of its prominent members had died in their beds, and it looked very much as if Angus, who succeeded &#x201c;Bell-�the-�Cat&#x201d; as earl in 1514, might be of their number, for it soon became apparent that he was determined to rule Scotland. His marriage to the Queen, and her subsequent advancement of the Douglases to high offices, excited the jealousy of the Scottish nobility and provoked the pro-�French party at court, which was headed by James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, a man renowned for his heroic triumphs in the tournament field; it reignited a centuries-�old feud between the Douglases and the Hamiltons, and gave rise to a civil war in Scotland. Scotland had long been allied to France, and both countries had a long history of enmity with England; but Margaret Tudor was determined to continue as regent with the pro-�English Angus at her side. Her opponents asserted that, under Scottish law, by remarrying she had forfeited the office of guardian (&#x201c;tutrix&#x201d;) to her under�age children. The Arran-�led Council resolved to replace her with John Stewart, Duke of Albany, a grandson of James II and the next royal heir after her sons. Albany was an honorable man and a capable administrator, but he regarded himself primarily as a Frenchman&#x2014;�he had been brought up in France, where he owned vast estates&#x2014;�and was reluctant to take up office in Scotland.<br><br>At once the Queen withdrew with her children to the safety of her mighty dower fortress of Stirling, set high on its volcanic crag at the gateway to the Scottish Highlands, against the spectacular backdrop of the Trossachs and the Ochil Hills; whereupon the Scottish lords rose in arms against her. Angus was ousted from power, and Albany, who was still in France, was offered the regency.<br><br>Queen Margaret appealed repeatedly to her brother, Henry VIII, for aid, impressing on him that &#x201c;all the welfare of me and my children lies in your hands.&#x201d;4 Henry threatened Scotland with war, while privately urging his sister to escape with her children to England, but she dared not attempt it because her enemies were keeping her under constant watch.<br><br>Margaret Tudor was six months&#x2019; pregnant with her first child by her new husband when, on July 12, 1515, the anti-�English Albany was formally installed as regent. He treated her with courtesy at first, but when he learned that Angus, fearing for the safety of the young King and his brother, was plotting to send them to England, he laid siege to Stirling, seized the little boys from the Queen, and made himself their custodian. Margaret Tudor had no choice but to consent; her supporters had either fled or been taken, and she herself was now a captive. In grief at losing her sons, she drew up a long &#x201c;remembrance&#x201d; of her complaints, which she sent to Thomas Magnus, the English ambassador to Scotland, who was then staying in Northumberland.5<br><br>Thereafter relations between Queen Margaret and Albany grew ever more tense. He made her write to her brother that she was content, and other letters &#x201c;contrary to her own mind,&#x201d; and he kept her &#x201c;strict prisoner&#x201d; and under surveillance in Edinburgh, so that she was unable to see her sons, whom Albany had &#x201c;in ward.&#x201d;6 He had also deprived her of her revenues, leaving her in extreme poverty.7 She entreated Henry VIII to send someone to mediate between her and the Regent; &#x201c;she was in much woe and pain, and besought remedy for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;8 But Albany was hostile to England, and for years would make every effort to raise an army and attack it. Effectively forcing Margaret Tudor into a position where she felt the need to flee from Scotland was an insult to Henry VIII, who naturally took her part and responded by offering her refuge.9<br><br>It was to the Queen&#x2019;s advantage that the birth of her child was approaching, for she was planning to flee to England before it was born. No one would suspect a woman going into seclusion of plotting an escape, for once she had taken to her chamber, she would remain there until she was fit enough for her churching, the ceremony of thanksgiving and purification that marked the end of a woman&#x2019;s confinement and her return to normal life.<br><br>On August 1 Margaret Tudor wrote from Edinburgh to Henry VIII: &#x201c;Brother, I purpose, by the grace of God, to take my chamber and lie in my palace of Linlithgow within this twelve days, for I have not past eight weeks to my time, at the which I pray Jesu to send me good speed and happy deliverance.&#x201d;10<br><br>Knowing that she could count on the aid of her brother, she sent her trusty servant, Robert Carr, to Thomas Magnus and Lord Dacre to ask them to inform the King of her secret plans, and ask for his assistance, which he had already commanded Dacre to extend to her.11<br><br>Lord Dacre was then forty-�eight, fierce, indefatigable and politic�ally astute.12 In 1485 he had fought for the last Plantagenet King, Richard III, against the future Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth, but had quickly made his peace with the Tudor victor, who had made him a Knight of the Bath. Dacre had been serving on the Scottish Marches since 1485, and had been made Warden General in 1509 by Henry VIII. He had fought against the Scots at Flodden, but he had been willing to help Margaret Tudor smuggle her sons into England earlier in 1515. At that time she had expressed fears that Scotland was so infested by robbers as to render traveling dangerous, but that seemed the lesser evil now. Dacre and Magnus assured their master that, &#x201c;notwithstanding her Grace is within six weeks of her lying down, yet she hath ascertained us she hath good health, and is strong enough to take upon her this journey.&#x201d;13<br><br>On September 1, 1515 Lord Dacre wrote to Queen Margaret, urging her to make haste to steal away to Blackadder Tower. Its owner, Andrew Blackadder, had fought and fallen under the Douglas standard at Flodden, and his widow and daughters were loyal. Dacre assured Margaret Tudor that, considering she was near her time, this was the best course of action. She would want for neither household goods nor money, and if all went to plan, her children would be safely restored to her and she herself would be restored as regent. Dacre himself would rendezvous with the Queen and escort her through the marsh where Blackadder Tower stood, &#x201c;so that you can resort [there] without any danger.&#x201d;14<br><br>But on September 3, Margaret Tudor informed Dacre that she had a strategy of her own.15 Feigning sickness, she obtained Albany&#x2019;s permission to remove with her husband to Linlithgow Palace for the birth of their child.16 She and Angus traveled there on September 11, closely followed by a letter from Lord Dacre informing the Queen that Henry VIII had been advised of her plight, and had confirmed his offer of asylum in England. Everything was now in place for her escape.<br><br>After the birth of her daughter Margaret Tudor &#x201c;fell into such extreme sickness that her life was despaired of by all.&#x201d;17 Given the drama of her flight and the stress she had suffered, that was hardly surprising.<br><br>Dacre evidently thought the birth of a daughter of little import-�ance, and it was not until October 18 that he informed Henry VIII that on &#x201c;the eighth day after that the Queen of Scots, your sister, came and entered into this your realm, her Grace was delivered and brought in bed of a fair young lady.&#x201d; He added that &#x201c;the sudden time, by God&#x2019;s provision so chanced,&#x201d; took them all unawares. His excuse for not writing sooner was that he had been too busy, and he had not thought it worth sending a letter for the sole purpose of informing the King that he had a new niece.18<br><br>The Queen&#x2019;s child was christened the day after her birth,19 on October 8, the ceremony probably being held in the castle chapel; at the font she was given the name Margaret, after her mother.20 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, the minister who was all-�powerful at the English court, had been chosen by Queen Margaret as a godparent, in absentia.21 Dacre was to explain to the King that the baptism had taken place &#x201c;with such convenient provisions as could or might be had in this barren and wild country,&#x201d; although everything had been &#x201c;done accordingly as appertained to the honour of the same,&#x201d; considering the suddenness of the birth.22<br><br>Because she was born in Northumberland, the &#x201c;fair young lady&#x201d; started life as an English subject. Her uncle, Henry VIII, had as yet no surviving child to succeed him; his nearest heirs were his sister, Margaret Tudor, and her children, James V and now Margaret Douglas. Although Henry VII, in his will, had not excluded Margaret Tudor&#x2019;s issue from the succession, James V was not an Englishman; since the fourteenth century there had been a common-�law rule against alien inheritance,23 and a majority opinion in England held that that applied to the royal succession. Hence Margaret Douglas was second in line to the English throne after her mother until such time as Henry&#x2019;s Queen, Katherine of Aragon, bore a living child&#x2014;�and Dacre was wrong to regard her as a person of little political importance.<br><br>On October 10, three days after the birth, Queen Margaret was sufficiently recovered to write reprovingly to Albany: &#x201c;Cousin, I heartily commend me unto you, and where I have been enforced for fear and danger of my life to depart forth of the realm of Scotland, so it is that, by the grace of Almighty God, I am now delivered and have a Christian soul, being a young lady.&#x201d; She demanded to be reinstated in the regency, desiring him &#x201c;in God&#x2019;s name, as tutrix of the young King and Prince, my tender childer, to have the whole rule and governance&#x201d; of them and of Scotland.24<br><br>Albany refused, informing her that &#x201c;the governance of the realm expired with the death of her husband, and devolved to the estates&#x201d; and &#x201c;that she had forfeited the tutelage of her children by her second marriage&#x201d;; if she would not listen to reason, he would be compelled to resort to sterner measures to prevent the disunion between the two kingdoms.25<br><br>Angus, meanwhile, had entered into a solemn covenant with several powerful, sympathetic nobles to liberate James V and his brother and unite in opposition to Albany. That was sufficiently alarming for Albany to offer the Queen apologies, terms and the return of her jewelry; he said he would even take Angus into favor if she would return to Scotland; but she refused.26<br><br>When, on October 18, Dacre informed Henry VIII of Margaret&#x2019;s birth, he asked what was to be done with his royal guest. Her lying-�in was proving &#x201c;uneaseful and costly&#x201d; because all necessities had to be carried some distance to Harbottle, so he was &#x201c;minded to move her Grace to remove to Morpeth&#x201d; as soon as she had been churched. Dacre evidently feared that Margaret Tudor would make difficulties about the move, as he suggested to the King that &#x201c;it may like your Highness to signify your mind and pleasure unto her, that we may move her accordingly.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as he had been informed of his sister&#x2019;s imminent arrival in England, Henry VIII had sent one of his gentlemen ushers, Sir Christopher Garnish, north with suitably royal clothing, plate and other necessities for her and her child. Garnish deposited these at Morpeth, then traveled to Harbottle with a letter from Henry that was &#x201c;grea...</p><h2>Kabbalah and the Age of the Universe</h2><p>This essay is an examination of the age of the universe as discussed in Kabbalistic works. <p> It is important to realize that the Kabbalistic texts do not only discuss mysticism, but also many areas of hashkafah (Jewish outlook) which are of great importance to us. </p><p> Let us begin with the classic question asked about the age of the universe.

While some yahoo spewing insults about your favorite sports team is worlds apart from a drug-crazed lunatic lunging at you with a sharp knife in his hands and bloodlust in his eyes, there is a large gray area in between these two extremes where hard and fast rules do not always apply. This is where wisdom, oftentimes hard-earned wisdom, makes the difference between good decisions and bad ones.<br>Every time you engage in violence, no matter how small or trivial it may appear to be at the time, it has the potential of escalating into something extraordinarily serious. What is really worth fighting for when you might find yourself spending the rest of your life behind bars, confined to a wheelchair, or trying to dig yourself out of bankruptcy from beneath the crushing weight of a civil lawsuit? It is important to ask yourself, "Is this really worth fighting over?" While in some instances the response could legitimately be "Yes," more often than not it ought to be "No."<br><br>More than mere techniques, this book fills in crucial information about street survival that most martial arts instructors don't teach or even know. You will learn how to use awareness, avoidance, and de-escalation to help stave off violence. Despite the best intentions, however, you may still find yourself in situations where you have no choice but to fight and others where it is prudent to do so. Consequently you will also learn smart things you might want to try and dumb things you should attempt to avoid during a physical confrontation.<br><br>In addition to learning strategies and techniques for defending yourself on the street you will also learn how to manage the aftermath of violence, including performing first aid, interacting with law enforcement, managing witnesses, finding a good attorney, navigating the legal system, dealing with the press, and overcoming psychological trauma. <br><br>Men, who commit about 80 percent of all violent crimes, are twice as likely to become victims of aggressive behavior as women. While written primarily for this at-risk demographic, this comprehensive tome is essential reading for anyone who regularly deals with violence, thinks they may encounter a hostile situation, or who simply wants to increase their ability to survive a dangerous encounter.</p><p>Praise for <i>The Little Black Book of Violence</i>:<br><br>"<i>This book will save lives.

She was the author of Cogewea, The Half-Blood (one of the first novels to be published by a Native American woman) and Coyote Stories, both reprinted as Bison Books. Jay Miller, formerly assistant director and editor at the D&#39;Arcy McNickle Center for the History of the American Indian, Newberry Library, Chicago, now is an independent scholar and writer in Seattle. He is the compiler of Earthmaker: Tribal Stories from Native North America.</p><p>"An exciting story that transports the reader to another time and place. . . . Anyone interested in American Indian history, culture, religion, and literature should read this informative volume that was produced at such great cost. "Mourning Dove" literally gave her life to do this work, and Jay Miller has painstakingly edited it to share the words and wisdom of Humishuma with the non-Salish world."-"American Indian Culture and Research Journal,"<p><br><br>"Mourning Dove's evocation of the complexities of tribal life is irresistible, full of acutely remembered conversations, ceremonies, and events."-Library Journal. "The accounts of guardian spirit quest, of seeking medicinal power, of winter dancing, seancind rite, and the sweatlodge unite cultural knowledge and personal experience in a compelling way. The perspective on history through the experience of her family is immensely valuable as well."-Dell Hymes, "Canadian Journal of Native Studies,"<br><br>"[This] autobiography artfully weaves tribal history, Salishan traditions, and a wealth of information of the female life cycle with the story of [Christine] Quintasket's own childhood and coming of age on the Colville Reservation in Washington. "Mourning Dove" is a rare and important study of the Interior Salish people during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Miller, by providing thoughtful editing and constructive footnotes, have given new life to Mourning Dove's narrative."-"Western Historical Quarterly,"</p>Mourning Dove (Christine Quintasket) spent her adult years justifying the ways of Native Americans to whites. Born into Colville Confederated Tribes in 1885 or 1888, she became an ethnographer, orator, pamphleteer, teacher, and novelist, believing that her description and analysis of Native American ways would ensure better treatment for her people. In the scholarly introduction to her unfinished autobiography, editor Miller describes his work with the Colvilles and his acquisition of Mourning Dove's manuscripts and notes, which he arranges according to important customs and cyclical/seasonal activities. Mourning Dove's evocation of the complexities of tribal life is irresistible, full of acutely remembered conversations, ceremonies, and events. "What kept us going," she says, "was the knowledge that everything on earth has its purpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission. That is the Indian theory of existence." Notes, references, and photographs provide additional perspectives.

And so, by contagion, Montalbano&#x2019;s behavior would also prove at the very least unstable that morning. When this happened, it was best to see as few people as possible.</p><p>The more the years passed, the more sensitive he became to variations in the weather, just as greater or lesser humidity will affect the pain in an old man&#x2019;s bones. And he was less and less able to control himself, to hide his excesses of cheer and gloom.</p><p>In the time he&#x2019;d taken to go from his house in Marinella to the Casuzza district&#x2014;about ten miles consisting of dirt paths only good for tanks and of little country roads slightly less wide than a car&#x2014;the sky had turned from light pink to gray, and then from gray to a faded blue before stopping momentarily at a hazy off-white that blurred the outlines of things and muddled one&#x2019;s vision.</p><p>He&#x2019;d received a phone call at eight o&#x2019;clock that morning, just as he was finishing his shower. He&#x2019;d slept late because he knew he didn&#x2019;t have to go to the office that day.</p><p>His mood darkened. He hadn&#x2019;t been expecting any phone calls. Who could it be busting his chops first thing in the morning?</p><p>Theoretically, there shouldn&#x2019;t have been anyone at the station other than the telephone operator, since it was supposed to be a special day in Vig�ta.</p><p>Special in the sense that the illustrious Minister of the Interior, returning from a visit to the island of Lampedusa&#x2014;where the reception centers for immigrants (yes, they had the gall to call them that!) were no longer in a position to house so much as another one-month-old baby, being packed tighter than a can of sardines&#x2014;had expressed his intention to inspect the makeshift tent-camps that had been set up in Vig�ta, even though these were likewise stuffed to the gills, with the added aggravation that the poor wretches were forced to sleep on the ground and relieve themselves outside.</p><p>For this reason Hizzoner the C&#x2019;mishner Bonetti-Alderighi had mobilized the entire police forces of Montelusa as well as Vig�ta to line the streets the high dignitary was to travel, so that his tender ears would not hear the boos, Bronx cheers, and cusswords (called &#x201c;protests&#x201d; in proper Italian) of the population, but only the applause of four or five assholes paid for that express purpose.</p><p>Without a second thought, Montalbano had dumped the whole business onto the shoulders of Mim� Augello, his second-in-command, and had taken advantage of the situation to enjoy a day off. The mere sight of the Minister of the Interior on television was enough to set the inspector&#x2019;s blood boiling, so he could only imagine what it would be like seeing him personally in person.</p><p>The whole thing in the unstated hope that, out of respect for a representative of the government, nobody in Vig�ta or environs would kill anybody or commit any other crimes. The criminals would certainly be sensitive enough not to make trouble on a day of such joy.</p><p>So who could it be trying to reach him on the phone?</p><p>He decided not to answer. But the telephone, after falling briefly silent, started ringing again.</p><p>And what if it was Livia? Maybe needing to tell him something important? There was no getting around it: He had to pick up the receiver.</p><p>&#x201c;Hallo, Chief? <i>Catarella sum</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Montalbano froze. Catarella, speaking Latin? What was happening to the universe? Was the end of the world at hand?

Some peasant called our switchboard to let us know he found a coffin in his field.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Full or empty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t quite figure that out. It was a bad connection.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you send Catarella?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t seem like such a big deal.&#x201d;</p><p>He thanked Fazio and called Catarella back.</p><p>&#x201c;Is the coffin full or empty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chief, the caffin in quession&#x2019;s got iss lid coverin&#x2019; it an&#x2019; theretofore the contense o&#x2019; the foresaid caffin in&#x2019;t possible to know whass inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you didn&#x2019;t open it yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nossir, Chief, issomuch as there warn&#x2019;t no orders consoinin&#x2019; the raisin&#x2019; o&#x2019; the foresaid lid. But if you order me to open it, I&#x2019;ll open it. Bu&#x2019; iss useless, if y&#x2019;ask me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cuz the caffin in&#x2019;t empty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know cuz the peasant farmer jinnelman &#x2019;oo&#x2019;d be the owner o&#x2019; the land whereats the foresaid caffin happens a be allocated, an &#x2019;ooz name is Annibale Lococo, son o&#x2019; Giuseppe, an&#x2019; &#x2019;oo&#x2019;s right &#x2019;ere aside me, he lifted the lid jess anuff t&#x2019; see &#x2019;at the caffin was accappied.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By whom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By a dead poisson&#x2019;s body, Chief.&#x201d;</p><p>So it was a big deal after all, contrary to what Fazio had thought.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, wait for me there.&#x201d;</p><p>And so, cursing the saints, he&#x2019;d had to get in the car and drive off.</p><p>The coffin was the kind for third-class corpses, the poorest of the poor, of rough-hewn wood without so much as a coat of varnish.</p><p>A corner of white linen stuck out from under the lid, which had been laid down crooked.</p><p>Montalbano bent down to get a better look.

He was fiftyish and sinewy, with sunbaked skin.</p><p>Catarella was about one step away but standing at attention, unable to utter a word, overwhelmed by emotion at conducting an investigation alongside the inspector.</p><p>All around them, a desolate landscape, more rock than earth, a few rare trees suffering from millennia of water deprivation, shrubs of sorghum, huge clumps of wild weeds.

Brett&#x2019;s quintessential fantasy hero. These exciting origin tales follow Arlen as he learns to navigate a world where the elemental forces of evil conjure themselves from the earth each night.<br><br>Humanity has barely survived a demonic onslaught by using magical wards that protect their cities and homes. Only a handful of mercenaries and explorers risk traveling after the sun sets. Arlen, seeking adventure and fortune, is barely protected by the warded armor upon which he has inscribed intricate defensive runes. From a journey ferrying a wagonload of dynamite to a mountain stronghold, to a dangerous mission to recover desert treasures, Arlen faces friends and enemies with a strong arm and a cunning wit.<br></p><p><b>Peter V. Brett</b> is the bestselling author of The Demon Cycle, which includes <i>The Warded Man</i> (published as <i>The Painted Man</i> in the U.K.), <i>The Desert Spear</i>, and <i>The Daylight War</i>, and has two more forthcoming novels in the series. After writing <i>The Painted Man</i> during his commute on the F-train, he left his day job to pursue writing full time and currently lives in Brooklyn with his daughter, Cassandra.From Chapter One of <i>Brayan's Gold</i><br><br>It was a cool morning, dawn still an hour away, but Arlen was already sweating profusely in the new armor solid plates of hammered steel linked at the joints by rivets and fine interlocking rings. Beneath, he wore a quilted jacket and pants to keep the plates from digging into his skin, but it was scant protection when Cob tightened the rings.<br><br> All the more reason to make sure I get this right, Cob said. The better the fit, the less likely that will happen when you&#x2019;re running from a coreling on the road. A Messenger needs to be quick.&#x201d;<br><br> Don&#x2019;t see how I&#x2019;ll be anything near quick wrapped in bedquilt and carrying seventy pounds of steel on my back,&#x201d; Arlen said. And this corespawned thing&#x2019;s hot as firespit.&#x201d;<br><br> You&#x2019;ll be glad for the warmth on the windy trails to the Duke&#x2019;s Mines,&#x201d; Cob advised.<br><br>Arlen shook his head and lifted his heavy arm to look at the plates where he had painstakingly fluted wards into the steel with a tiny hammer and chisel. The symbols of protection were powerful enough to turn most any demon blow, but as much as he felt protected by the armor, he also felt imprisoned by it.<br><br> Five hundred suns,&#x201d; he said wistfully. That was how much the armorer had charged and taken months in the making. It was enough gold to make Arlen the second-richest man in Tibbet&#x2019;s Brook, the town where he had grown up.<br><br> You don&#x2019;t go cheap on things that might mean your life,&#x201d; Cob said. He was a veteran Messenger, and spoke from experience. When it comes to armor, you find the best smithy in town, order the strongest they&#x2019;ve got, and bugger the cost.&#x201d;<br><br>He pointed a finger at Arlen. And always . . .&#x201d;<br><br> . . . ward it yourself,&#x201d; Arlen finished with his master, nodding patiently. I know. You&#x2019;ve told me a thousand times.&#x201d;<br><br> I&#x2019;ll tell it to you ten thousand more, if that&#x2019;s how long it takes to etch it into your thick skull.&#x201d;<br></p><h2>Outdoor Moments with God</h2><p>An intimate and deeply spiritual recounting of moments spent with the Master&#x2014;working on the yard, hiking in the mountains, or simply surveying some magnificent expanse of land and sky.</p><p>In the introduction Keller writes, &#39;Why this book? The simple answer to that blunt question is that often outdoors flashes of inspiration come with brilliant illumination in a matter of moments. Suddenly, swiftly, clear spiritual perception of profound truth sweeps into my own spirit like an artist&#39;s painting in vivid colors. THE IMPRESSION COMES IN AN INSTANT BUT ENDURES FOREVER. THESE MOVING OUTDOOR MOMENTS STIR MY SOUL.&#39;W. Phillip Keller (1920-1997) wrote more than thirty-five books on Christian subjects, including his most popular book <i>A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23</i> The son of missionary parents in Kenya, Keller grow up in Africa before becoming a world citizen as a photographer, agronomist, and author. His books have over two million copies in print.</p><h2>Stolen Justice: The Struggle for African American Voting Rights (Scholastic Focus)</h2><p><b>A thrilling and incisive examination of the post-Reconstruction era struggle for and suppression of African American voting rights in the United States.</b><br><br>Following the Civil War, the Reconstruction era raised a new question to those in power in the US: Should African Americans, so many of them former slaves, be granted the right to vote?<br><br>In a bitter partisan fight over the legislature and Constitution, the answer eventually became yes, though only after two constitutional amendments, two Reconstruction Acts, two Civil Rights Acts, three Enforcement Acts, the impeachment of a president, and an army of occupation. Yet, even that was not enough to ensure that African American voices would be heard, or their lives protected. White supremacists loudly and intentionally prevented black Americans from voting -- and they were willing to kill to do so.<br><br>In this vivid portrait of the systematic suppression of the African American vote, critically acclaimed author Lawrence Goldstone traces the injustices of the post-Reconstruction era through the eyes of incredible individuals, both heroic and barbaric, and examines the legal cases that made the Supreme Court a partner of white supremacists in the rise of Jim Crow. Though this is a story of America's past, Goldstone brilliantly draws direct links to today's creeping threats to suffrage in this important and, alas, timely book.</p><p>Lawrence Goldstone has written more than a dozen books for adults, including three on Constitutional Law. <i>Unpunished Murder</i> was his first book on that subject for young readers. He lives in Sagaponack, New York, with his wife, medieval and Renaissance historian Nancy Goldstone.With the army concentrated in the cities or other densely populated areas, the Klan&#x2019;s reputation in the countryside as a terrorist organization beyond the reach of law spread dread among black residents. Often, Klan members needed simply to show up to keep black men from the voting booth. Even worse, in those cases, the Klan would not specifically have broken any laws.<br><br>"If a party of white men, with ropes conspicuous on their saddlebows, rode up to a polling place and announced that hanging would begin in fifteen minutes, though without any more definite reference to anybody, and a group of blacks who had assembled to vote heard the remark and promptly disappeared, votes were lost, but a conviction on a charge of intimidation was difficult. Or if an untraceable rumor that trouble was [looming] for blacks was followed by the mysterious appearance of horsemen on the roads at midnight, firing guns and yelling at nobody in particular, votes again were lost, but no crime or misdemeanor could be brought home to any one."<br><br>Even with the army in occupation, Klan terror was successful. In the presidential election of 1868, in eleven counties in Georgia, each with a majority of black voters, not a single vote was reported for Grant and the Republicans. That same year, when the Reconstruction state constitution was up for a vote in Mississippi, "it was charged by the Republicans . . . that whites terrorized the negroes by the Kuklux method, and either kept them away from the polls or intimidated them into voting against the Constitution."<br><br>By 1875, largely because of the campaign of terror by Klan groups and other violent white supremacist organizations, seven of the eleven secessionist states had been "Redeemed," or returned to Democratic control. The remaining four, Mississippi, Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina, would become the centers of both the war-at-any-cost effort to restore white rule and the last desperate attempts to maintain at least some areas of equal rights in the South.<br><br>Perched on the fulcrum of this seesaw was the United States Supreme Court.</p><h2>Luke: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching</h2><p><p>Using Luke's own prologue as the guideline for his commentary, Fred B.

That is just one of the many paradoxes, contradictions, and surprises in the relationship between Christianity and American culture. In this book George Marsden, a leading historian of American Christianity and award-winning author, tells the story of that relationship in a concise and thought-provoking way.</p><p>Surveying the history of religion and American culture from the days of the earliest European settlers right up through the elections of 2016, Marsden offers the kind of historically and religiously informed scholarship that has made him one of the nation&#x2019;s most respected and decorated historians. Students in the classroom and history readers of all ages will benefit from engaging with the story Marsden tells.</p></p><p><br><b>George Marsden</b>&nbsp;is professor emeritus of history at the University of Notre Dame. Among his many other books is&nbsp;<i>Jonathan Edwards: A Life</i>, which was named one of ten "Books of the Year" for 2003 by&nbsp;<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>&nbsp;and received the prestigious Bancroft Prize in history (2004), the Grawemeyer Award in religion (2005), and a half dozen other awards.<b>Thomas S. Kidd</b><br> &#x2014;&nbsp;Baylor University<br> &#x201c;At the outset of this book George Marsden makes the simple but profound observation that the United States is &#x2018;both remarkably religious and remarkably profane.&#x2019; This organizing principle helps make his&nbsp;<i>Religion and American Culture</i>&nbsp;an astute, accessible, and wonderful introduction to the fascinating puzzle of American religious history.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Kristin Du Mez</b><br> &#x2014; Calvin College<br> &#x201c;In this highly readable volume Marsden provides a sweeping overview of religion in American history. He not only sketches the landscape with enviable clarity but also offers an interpretive frame for understanding the relationship of American religion and culture&#x2014;and ultimately for comprehending a nation that is &#x2018;both remarkably religious and remarkably profane.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br><b>Rick Ostrander</b><br> &#x2014; Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities<br> &#x201c;Any list of the most influential American historians of the past half-century would undoubtedly include George Marsden. His&nbsp;<i>Religion and American Cultur</i>e is a careful, balanced assessment not only of Christianity&#x2019;s complex role in American history but also of American culture&#x2019;s influence on Christianity. No better brief yet profound treatment of Christianity&#x2019;s 400 years in the United States exists than this volume.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Darren Dochuk</b><br> &#x2014; University of Notre Dame<br> &#x201c;In this survey of the religious (and, paradoxically, secular) forces that have shaped American life over the past four centuries, Marsden masterfully weaves colorful insight and incisive analysis into an accessible narrative that readers of all levels will find highly instructive. This is a must-read, invaluable resource for anyone interested in making sense of past and current trends in American religious culture.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Rick Kennedy</b><br> &#x2014; Point Loma Nazarene University<br> &#x201c;With measured prose Marsden&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Religion and American Culture</i>&nbsp;deftly illuminates the consistently central role of people of faith in our country&#x2019;s history. Often dealing with matters that have been overheated by insistent polemics, Marsden broad-mindedly lets the chips fall where they may, allowing churches their role in sowing seeds both evil and good. The book is especially innovative when showing the role of Protestantism, Catholicism, and Judaism in elite political and intellectual circles from the 1870s to the 1970s.&#x201d;<br><br><b>John Fea</b><br> &#x2014; Messiah College<br> &#x201c;I am thrilled that Marsden&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Religion and American Culture</i>&nbsp;is back in print. While the text certainly stands alone as an introductory survey by one of our generation&#x2019;s greatest American religious historians, it will also serve as a supplementary textbook for teachers and professors who want to bring religious developments to bear on US history survey courses.&#x201d;</p><h2>Grow Great Grub: Organic Food from Small Spaces</h2><p><b>Your patio, balcony, rooftop, front stoop, boulevard, windowsill, planter box, or fire escape is a potential fresh food garden waiting to happen.

These narrow strips of paper, covered with tiny ant-like pencil markings a millimeter high, came to light only after the author&#x2019;s death in 1956.At first considered random restless pencil markings or a secret code, the microscripts were in time discovered to be a radically miniaturized form of antique German script: a whole story was deciphered on the back of a business card. These twenty-five short pieces address schnapps, rotten husbands, small town life, elegant jaunts, the radio, swine, jealousy, and marriage proposals.</p><p><p><strong>Robert Walser</strong> (1878&#x2013;1956) was born in Switzerland. He left school at fourteen and led a wandering and precarious existence working as a bank clerk, a butler in a castle, and an inventor's assistant while producing essays, stories, and novels. In 1933 he abandoned writing and entered a sanatorium&#x2015;where he remained for the rest of his life. "I am not here to write," Walser said, "but to be mad."</p><p><strong>Susan Bernofsky</strong> is the acclaimed translator of Hermann Hesse, Robert Walser, and Jenny Erpenbeck, and the recipient of many awards, including the Helen and Kurt Wolff Prize and the Hermann Hesse Translation Prize. She teaches literary translation at Columbia University and lives in New York.</p>&#x201c;The use of throwaway scraps and pencil also seems part of a deliberate espousal of the small and modest, an attention to the unnoticed, and the microscripts are, as this edition lets us see, objects of beauty, the pencillings precisely filling their allotted space, the different texts neatly fitted together on the same piece of paper like some kind of intricate insect construction whose purpose is absolutely necessary.... Walser has in recent years regained some of the status he enjoyed in the 1920s. Instead of Kafka and Benjamin, we have Sebald and Lydia Davis championing him. But we still don't know where we stand with him. Are we dealing with pure literature,the vagaries of the everyday, jokes, or empty fancies? The writing is radical and elegant enough to encompass all these possibilities and many more. Is it the stuff of life? Perhaps.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times Literary Supplement</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Walser vaulted new heights of expression with minuscule means.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Boston Globe</em></strong></p><h2>Nothing to Grasp</h2><p>This book points relentlessly to what is most obvious and impossible to avoid: the ever-present, ever-changing, nonconceptual actuality of the present moment that is effortlessly presenting itself right now. This book is an invitation to wake up from commonplace misconceptions and to see through the imaginary separate self at the root of our human suffering and confusion. <i>Nothing to Grasp</i> is a celebration of what is, exactly as it is.<br></p><p>A friend challenged me to write a short, concise book that would say what I most want to express as simply and clearly as possible. This book is the response to that challenge. It points to this ungraspable and yet unavoidable present happening, just exactly as it is. It points beyond concepts and beliefs to direct experience here and now. I hope the book will invite the reader to explore their actual present moment experiencing, to see through the stories of lack and the mirage of future attainment, and to discover the freedom that is Here / Now, the freedom for everything to be just as it is. The book explores many questions: What is meant by &#34;no self&#34; or &#34;not taking your life personally&#34; or &#34;you are not the body&#34;? Who or what is in charge of &#34;your life&#34;? What is enlightenment? Is there anything to do in order to wake up? How does suffering end? How is it possible to reconcile all the seemingly contradictory expressions of nonduality and all the seemingly contradictory approaches to waking up? Hopefully, this book is a simple, clear pointer to what is obvious, unavoidable and right here, right now.Joan Tollifson writes and talks about the ever-changing, ever-present aliveness of Here / Now, that which is obvious, unavoidable and impossible to doubt. She has an affinity with Advaita, Zen and radical nonduality, but she belongs to no tradition or lineage. Joan explores nonduality in the context of everyday life, drawing from her own experiences with addiction, disability, and other human issues. She is the author of Bare-Bones Meditation: Waking Up from the Story of My Life (1996), Awake in the Heartland: The Ecstasy of What Is (2003/2006), Painting the Sidewalk with Water: Talks and Dialogs about Nonduality (2010), Nothing to Grasp (2012), and Death: The End of Self-Improvement (still in progress and slated for publication in 2013). Joan has lived in California, New York and Chicago, and is currently living in southern Oregon.</p><h2>Understanding Colonial Handwriting (Rev)</h2><p>In genealogical research it is all very well to locate original records, but to read them correctly is another matter altogether. Few people know this better than Harriet Stryker-Rodda who, after years of experience searching through colonial records, has developed a simple technique for reading colonial handwriting. In this handy little book, Mrs. Stryker-Rodda presents examples of colonial letter forms and script, showing the letter forms in the process of development and marking the ways in which they differ from later letter forms. She also provides a comparison of English and American handwriting and examples of name forms and signatures all to bear out her central thesis, that the reader must find meaning in a group of symbols without needing to see each letter of which the whole is composed. This excellent guidebook is indispensable in dealing with the problems of reading and interpretation.</p><p></p><h2>Building the Columbia River Highway: They Said It Couldn&#39;t Be Done</h2><p>When nine-hundred-foot ice age floods carved the Columbia River Gorge through the Cascade Mountains to the sea, little space was left for man to form a highway of his own.

The intention of this book, however, is not to engage in theological disputes directly, but rather to survey the field from the vantage-point of the history of religion, and to unravel the characteristics of the Christian liturgy that link it to the universality of the sacred.<p> &#x201c;Through his research into hidden or lost meanings, Jean Hani has revealed and restored to our attention the most &#x2018;initiatic&#x2019; dimensions of the Christian religion.&#x201d; Jean Borella, author of The Secret of the Christian Way, and The Crisis of Religious Symbolism (forthcoming from Angelico Press)</p></p><p>Jean Hani (1917&#x2013;2012), former professor emeritus at the University of Amiens, was the founder of the Centre de Recherche sur l&#x2019;Antiquit� Classique and a frequent contributor to the journal Connaissance des Religions. After writing his PhD thesis on the influence of Egyptian thought upon Plutarch, he produced annotated translations of the latter&#x2019;s writings for the well-known Collection Bud�. Later he became known for his mastery of traditional hermeneutics and exegesis, and his broad knowledge in the field of comparative religion. Hani&#x2019;s writing is sensitive to the predicament of those moderns who seek a firm foundation in traditional Christian values, while striving also to integrate into that foundation whatever of value can be salvaged from the contemporary world. His findings were presented in four important works now available from Angelico Press in translation: the present volume, along with Divine Craftsmanship (Preliminaries to a Spirituality of Work), The Symbolism of the Christian Temple, and The Black Virgin (A Marian Mystery).</p><h2>George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography</h2><p>This is the groundbreaking classic expose of the Bush family, cited by all that followed it, yet still unmatched.

When she discovers a trunk left behind by Penny Wentworth, a young newlywed who lived on the boat half a century earlier, she is immediately drawn into this long lost story. Ever-curious, Ada longs to know her predecessor&#x2019;s fate, but does not suspect that Penny&#x2019;s mysterious past and her own clouded future are destined to converge...</p><p>As I type this, I'm sitting in my houseboat, looking out the window to a gray day on Lake Union in Seattle. The rain is falling in great sheets. It pounds on the roof, and the wind splatters it against the windows. These are my favorite days on the lake. I can see ducks swim and boats motor by, as well as the occasional kayaker braving the rain. It's cozy, and I'm content.<br><br> When I set out to write this novel, I began with a setting, and nothing else: a houseboat on the banks of Lake Union. As a lifelong Seattle-area resident, I've always been fascinated by floating homes (and of course, a little movie called Sleepless in Seattle only furthered that fascination). Years ago, as a young journalist, I wrote an article about the houseboat lifestyle, and I'll never forget being invited to tour a floating home for the first time. The woman who graciously welcomed me into her home (through a door with an opening in the bottom for ducks) told me about life on the lake--the way a houseboat sways gently in the wind, how the lake can rock you to sleep, and perhaps most memorable, for me, the way the houseboat community is like a family, helping neighbors in need, keeping secrets like only trusted friends do.<br><br> I suppose the very beginning of this novel started that day, when I stepped inside that little floating home. And as time went on, I longed to live in a houseboat of my own. But as our family grew, my husband and I decided that raising three little boys on a tiny floating home may not be the best choice (imagine playing catch on a small dock). So we set that dream aside, at least until September 2012.<br><br> My husband knew I'd begun plotting out an idea for a novel set on a houseboat, and while I'd hoped to find one to rent for a weekend for research purposes, he surprised me with a generous idea. Why not, he suggested, rent a houseboat for an extended period of time? I could use it as my office, and really get the feel for life on the lake.<br><br> My first instinct was to say no. At first blush, it seemed frivolous, an unnecessary splurge. But then I began to think: How else would I really get to know the houseboat lifestyle, the history of the community, the local personalities and their secrets?<br><br> So we went to tour a houseboat for rent, and in the space of 3.5 seconds, I fell head over heels. With a loft bedroom (complete with a working porthole), a rooftop deck with a view of the Space Needle, and a quaint and fully stocked kitchen, this was the houseboat of my dreams. My husband and I quickly signed a lease to rent it for four months.<br><br> I could not have written this book without the time I've had on Lake Union. While it's true this is a work of fiction, the months I've spent in the houseboat community have enriched and inspired my writing--from the pair of mallards nesting outside my back deck to the kindness of the neighbors all around me.<br><br> We have a few more weeks on our little floating home before our lease runs out. I really hate to go. I've laughed here. I've cried here. I've made new friends and bonded with old ones under this roof. I've felt a great sense of peace here. And mostly, I have fallen in love with the houseboat community.<br><br> But it's almost time to say good-bye. For when I turn in the final draft of this novel in the days ahead, I will also be turning in my key and saying good-bye to my beloved Boat Street, as I've affectionately called it in real life and in the novel. Even so, the dock, and the story I created here, will forever remain in my heart. Houseboat No. 7. Henrietta and Haines. Little Jimmy. Penny and Collin. Alex and Ada. I feel as if they're all waving good-bye as I make my way up the dock. Years will pass, but I'll always know where to find them.<br><br> SJ<p><b>Sarah Jio </b>is the #1 international, <i>New York Times,</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of eight novels.

It does so by defining the state of the class system in contemporary Europe in which a larger, lower class is controlled and oppressed by a tyrannical, oppressive upper class. <i>The Manifesto</i> argues that, at some point in history, the lower class will inevitably realize their potential and exploitation and subsequently revolt. Once this occurs, Marx and Engels argue, there will be an uprising among proletariats that shifts political and economic power, ultimately resulting in the dismantling of class systems and capitalism. Additionally, in the <i>Manifesto</i>, Marx and Engels also predict the future state of the global economy and discuss their viewpoints on private property, while also addressing many other topics pertinent to today&#x2019;s world.<br><br>Although written nearly 170 years ago, <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> is still widely read and cited. Amid the current turmoil between social classes and the societies of the world, its revolutionary prose and ideas can still yield ripe food for thought.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles.<b>Karl Marx</b> was a philosopher, socialist, sociologist, and journalist. He&#x2019;s often been called one of the most influential figures in history and is the father of Marxism. His work was and is widely read, the most well-known being <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>.

In <i>What It Means to Be a Libertarian,</i> he proposes a government reduced to the barest essentials: an executive branch consisting only of the White House and trimmed-down departments of state, defense, justice, and environment protection; a Congress so limited in power that it meets only a few months each year; and a federal code stripped of all but a handful of regulations.<br>Combining the tenets of classical Libertarian philosophy with his own highly-original, always provocative thinking, Murray shows why less government advances individual happiness and promotes more vital communities and a richer culture. By applying the truths our founders held to be self-evident to today's most urgent social and political problems, he creates a clear, workable vision for the future.</p><p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>In the last quarter of the eighteenth century the American Founders created asociety based on the belief that human happiness is intimately connected withpersonal freedom and responsibility. The twin pillars of the system theycreated were limits on the power of the central government and protection ofindividual rights.</p><p>A few people, of whom I am one, think that the Founders' insights are as truetoday as they were two centuries ago. We believe that human happiness requiresfreedom and that freedom requires limited government. Limited government meansa very small one, shorn of almost all the apparatus we have come to take forgranted during the last sixty years. </p><p>Most people are baffled by such a view. Don't we realize that this ispostindustrial America, not Jefferson's agrarian society? Don't we realize thatwithout big government millions of the elderly would be destitute, corporationswould destroy the environment, and employers would be free once more to exploittheir workers? Where do we suppose blacks would be if it weren't for thegovernment? Women? Haven't we noticed that America has huge social problemsthat aren't going to be dealt with unless the government does something aboutthem?</p><p>This book tries to explain how we can believe that the less government, thebetter. Why a society run on the principles of limited government would advancehuman happiness. How such a society would lead to greater individualfulfillment, more vital communities, a richer culture. Why such a society wouldcontain fewer poor people, fewer neglected children, fewer criminals. How sucha society would not abandon the less fortunate but would care for them betterthan does the society we have now.</p><p>Many books address the historical, economic, sociological, philosophical, andconstitutional issues raised is pages.

In What It Means to Be a Libertarian, he proposes a government reduced to the barest essentials: an executive branch consisting only of the White House and trimmed-down departments of state, defense, justice, and environmental protection; a Congress so limited in power that it meets only a few months each year; and a federal code stripped of all but a handful of regulations. Combining the tenets of classical libertarian philosophy with his own provocative thinking, Murray shows why less government advances individual happiness and promotes more vital communities and a richer culture.</p></p><h2>The Celebrant: A Novel</h2><p>The first two decades of the twentieth century were a time of promise and innocence in America. Hardworking immigrants could achieve the American dream; heroes were truly heroic. Eric Rolfe Greenberg brilliantly and authentically chronicles the real-life saga of the first national baseball hero, Christy Mathewson, and the fictional story of a Jewish immigrant family of jewelers. In these pages Mathewson and other great players like John McGraw, Honus Wagner, and Connie Mack discover the realities behind the shining illusions: the burdens of being a hero and the temptations that taint success.</p><p>In the <i>Ragtime</i> tradition of revolving a fictional world around a factual core, Greenberg's 1983 novel is a polished gem, which is fitting because it is partly built around a jeweler. Though <i>The Celebrant</i> never caught on much with the general public, its adherents were virtual zealots; to them, reading the novel bordered on having a religious experience. Its sophisticated weaving together of the life of Christy Mathewson, the Giants' great hurler and role model, with a family of immigrant Jews in New York in the first quarter of the 20th century captured their imaginations--then sadly disappeared for almost a decade before its welcome reissue. <p> On the surface, <i>The Celebrant</i> is obviously a baseball story--many of "Matty's" greatest on-field feats are meticulously recreated--as well as a story of how deeply the game reached into the lives of new arrivals from the Old World desperate to become American. On a deeper level, it is a stunning meditation on the fragile balance between the heroism of a man who won World Series rings and the hero worship of the young jeweler who made those rings for him. Its simplicity is deceptive. <i>The Celebrant</i> does much more than celebrate; it paints the corners of another era and another ethos with the command and control Matty himself was known to exhibit. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio</p><h2>Loving Our Kids on Purpose: Making a Heart to Heart Connection</h2><p><p><b>Here is a fresh look at the age-old role of parenting.</b></p> <p><i>Loving Our Kids on Purpose</i> brings the principles of the Kingdom of God and revival into our strategy as parents.</p> <p>2 Corinthians 3:17 tells us that &#x201c;Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.&#x201d;</p> <p>Most parenting approaches train children to learn to accept being controlled by well meaning parents and adults.

John F. Kennedy, Frank O&#x2019;Hara, Allen Ginsberg, Merce Cunningham, and Fairfield Porter were just some of the figures who sat for portraits by Elaine de Kooning. Famous for her marriage to the Abstract Expressionist Willem de Kooning, Elaine was herself a groundbreaking artist and writer who challenged many conventions during her career. Although she portrayed women, she was most engaged with portraits of men, sometimes painting multiple portraits of her subjects in order to explore and capture their most compelling likeness. She focused intently on her subjects&#x2015;as she wrote in 1965, &#x201c;Like falling in love painting a portrait is a concentration on one particular person and no one else will do.&#x201d; This insightful book explores de Kooning&#x2019;s portraits as well as her artistic process and her position in the rise of Postmodernism. Illustrated throughout with full-color reproductions of paintings, drawings, and archival photos, this book is an important contribution to the literature on Abstract Expressionism, women artists, and feminism during a transformative period, and will also appeal to lovers of painting of all kinds.</p><p>Brandon Brame Fortune is Chief Curator at the Smithsonian&#39;s National Portrait Gallery.

He wrote his now-renowned book <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> in 1936. This milestone cemented the rapid spread of his core values across the United States. During the 1950s, the foundations of Dale Carnegie Training� as it exists today began to take form. Dale Carnegie himself passed away soon after in 1955, leaving his legacy and set of core principles to be disseminated for decades to come. Today, the Dale Carnegie Training programs are available in more than&nbsp;30 languages throughout the entire United States and in more than 85 countries. &nbsp;Dale Carnegie includes as its clients 400 of the Fortune 500 companies. &nbsp;Approximately 7 million people have experienced Dale Carnegie Training.C h a p t e r 1 <br><br><i>Keys to High Impact Delivery <br><br></i>The Dale Carnegie organization is the world&#x2019;s leading <br><br>resource for public speaking mastery, and this has <br><br>been true for almost a century. Just as certainly, the <br><br>Nightingale-Conant Corporation is the world leader in audio <br><br>learning technology. Now, Dale Carnegie and Nightingale- <br><br>Conant are proud to bring you this definitive book on speaking <br><br>in public. So whether you&#x2019;re just starting out, or if you already <br><br>have extensive experience with oral presentations, <i>Stand and <br><br>Deliver </i>will take you to the next level of mastery. <br><br>Literally since the dawn of civilization, speaking well in <br><br>front of others has been an ongoing human challenge. This <br><br>was especially true for the classical civilizations of Greece and <br><br>Rome, but public speaking ability was also highly esteemed in <br><br>biblical times, and by Native American tribes, and by the cultures <br><br>of India and China. Fascinating as it might be, however, <br><br>our purpose here is not a history lesson. So right at the outset, <br><br>we&#x2019;re going to introduce three key tools for creating a high impact <br><br>presentation. These are timeless principles upon which all <br><br>great speakers have relied&#x2014;though each has done so in his or <br><br>her own way. By blending your unique identity with the universal <br><br>principles we&#x2019;re about to discuss, you can transform yourself <br><br>into an effective public speaker almost instantly. So please read <br><br>carefully. What you&#x2019;re about to learn will have a dramatic effect <br><br>not only on how you communicate to others, but on how you <br><br>see yourself as well. <br><br>Human beings are <i>talking </i>beings. We start talking when we <br><br>wake up in the morning and we keep at it until we go to sleep&#x2014; <br><br>and some people don&#x2019;t even stop then. Good conversation is one <br><br>of the great joys of human commerce. Good conversation should <br><br>be like the game of tennis, in which the ball is struck back and <br><br>forth, with each player participating equally. Bores are like golfers <br><br>who just keep hitting their own ball, over and over and over. <br><br>Good conversationalists make good speakers. They&#x2019;re sensitive <br><br>to the presence of others. Their antennae are forever alert, <br><br>picking up signals from their audience and responding to those <br><br>signals in the presentation. Good speakers achieve a marvelous <br><br>give-and-take with listeners, just as good conversationalists do <br><br>in a social setting. <br><br>More specifically, both speakers and conversationalists recognize <br><br>that people desire recognition more than any other <br><br>factor. They frequently ask questions such as &#x201c;Do you agree <br><br>with that?&#x201d; Then they&#x2019;ll pause and read the response that&#x2019;s <br><br>forthcoming. It might be silence, rapt attention, nods, laughter, <br><br>or concern. If listeners are bored, they will always find ways <br><br>of showing that, despite their polite efforts to hide their feelings. <br><br>If they&#x2019;re interested, they&#x2019;ll show that too. As speakers, <br><br>we have a duty to be interesting or we shouldn&#x2019;t stand before <br><br>an audience in the first place. Creating interest is the task of the <br><br>speaker, whether we&#x2019;re the manager of the sales force in a car <br><br>dealership, an insurance agency, a real estate office, or a large <br><br>international organization. When interest leaves, the sell goes <br><br>out of our message.<br><br>Our responsibility is not only to create a speech that will lead <br><br>an audience to a believable conclusion. We must also make the <br><br>building blocks of that conclusion as fascinating as we can. In <br><br>this way we can hold the attention of our audience until we get <br><br>to that all-important final point. In addition, if we can develop <br><br>techniques that make our audience feel that we are conversing <br><br>with them, we will convey that we care what they are thinking, <br><br>and that will create the emotional climate for them to accept us <br><br>as favorably as possible. <br><br>Along with understanding the similarities between speaking <br><br>in conversation and speaking in public, you should also <br><br>understand certain important differences. You need to master <br><br>certain key skills that <i>create the illusion </i>that your presentation <br><br>is as personal as a one-on-one conversation&#x2014;but that illusion <br><br>is only possible when you&#x2019;ve professionalized yourself as a <br><br>speaker. David Letterman has the ability to speak with virtually <br><br>anybody while 10 million viewers are looking in. Yet he&#x2019;s able <br><br>to make this seem as casual as a break at the office watercooler. <br><br>Now, you many not think of David Letterman as a great public <br><br>speaker, but he draws on the same principles that virtually <br><br>every accomplished speaker has used since ancient times. <br><br>What are these principles? The first is actually quite obvious, <br><br>and maybe that&#x2019;s why so many speakers seem to forget <br><br>it. It can be stated in a single, short sentence: <i>know what you&#x2019;re <br><br>talking about</i>. Learn the material so well that you own it. Don&#x2019;t <br><br>just have some expertise in your topic&#x2014;<i>master it</i>. Be able to <br><br>fill every second of your presentation with solid content. Once <br><br>you&#x2019;re able to do that, 90 percent of your work will be done before <br><br>you even get up in front of the audience. <br><br>To make this point, Dale Carnegie liked to invoke the <br><br>example of Luther Burbank, a great scientist by any measure <br><br>and probably the greatest botanist of all time. Burbank once <br><br>said, &#x201c;I have often produced a million plants in order to find one <br><br>or two really good ones&#x2014;and then I destroyed all the inferior <br><br>specimens.&#x201d; A presentation ought to be prepared in that same <br><br>lavish and discriminating spirit. Assemble a hundred thoughts <br><br>and discard ninety&#x2014;or even ninety-nine. Collect more material, <br><br>more information, than there is any possibility of employing. <br><br>Gather it for the additional confidence it will give you, and <br><br>for the sureness of touch. Gather it for the effect it will have on <br><br>your mind and heart and whole manner of speaking. This is a <br><br>basic factor in preparation. Yet speakers constantly ignore it. <br><br>Mr. Carnegie actually believed that speakers should know forty <br><br>times more about their topic than they share in a presentation! <br><br>Knowing one topic supremely well is obviously much more <br><br>practical than trying to master a larger number. Professional <br><br>salespeople, marketing experts, and leaders in the advertising <br><br>profession know the importance of selling one thing at a time. <br><br>Only catalogs can successfully handle a multitude of items. In <br><br>a five-minute speech or even a long speech, it&#x2019;s important to <br><br>have a single theme, and like a good salesperson, you pose the <br><br>problem and then give your solution. At the end, the problem is <br><br>restated and the solution quickly summarized. <br><br>Your opening statement should be an attention getter. For <br><br>example, you might say, &#x201c;Scientists all over the world are <br><br>agreed that the world&#x2019;s oceans are dying.&#x201d; A sobering thought <br><br>indeed. It captures immediate interest, and everyone is thinking, <br><br>&#x201c;Why, that would presage the end of the world. What are <br><br>we doing about it?&#x201d; <br><br>By invoking an internationally recognized authority as <br><br>your reference&#x2014;someone such as the late Jacques Cousteau, <br><br>for instance&#x2014;you provide supporting evidence that your <br><br>opening remark is true, then you outline the possible ways <br><br>that the disaster might be averted. At the end, you might say, <br><br>&#x201c;Yes, the oceans of the world are dying today, but if we can <br><br>marshal the combined efforts of the world&#x2019;s peoples, if we can <br><br>influence every maritime country to pass laws governing the <br><br>pollution of the seas by oil tankers . . .&#x201d; So you end on a note <br><br>of hope and at the same time enlist the sympathy of every one <br><br>of your listeners in your cause. <br><br>Not all talks are about social problems, of course. You might <br><br>be talking about a recent fishing trip, in which case you find <br><br>something of special interest in the story and open with that. <br><br>You might say, &#x201c;Ounce for ounce, the rainbow trout is one of <br><br>the gamest fish on earth.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a much better attention getter <br><br>and interest stimulator than saying, &#x201c;I want to tell you about <br><br>my recent fishing trip.&#x201d; After a few words about the fish you <br><br>were after, you can work in the rest. &#x201c;Two weeks ago, John <br><br>Cooper and I decided to try our luck on the White River near <br><br>Carter, Arkansas. It&#x2019;s one of the most naturally beautiful spots <br><br>in the country . . .&#x201d; Stay with the trip and that rainbow trout, <br><br>the hero of your story, and how good it tasted cooked over an <br><br>open fire on the bank of the river. Then at the close, to more <br><br>closely link your listeners to the subject, you might say, &#x201c;If <br><br>you&#x2019;ve never been trout fishing, let me recommend it as one of <br><br>the world&#x2019;s best ways to forget your problems, clear your brain, <br><br>and gain a new perspective. And when you hook a rainbow <br><br>trout, you&#x2019;re in for one of the greatest thrills of a lifetime.&#x201d; <br><br>Watch your personal pronouns. Keep yourself out of your <br><br>conversation as much as possible. In the fishing story, talk <br><br>about the fish, the beautiful scenery, your companions, other <br><br>people you met, a humorous incident or two perhaps, but don&#x2019;t <br><br>keep saying, &#x201c;I did this&#x201d; and &#x201c;I did that.&#x201d; The purpose of the <br><br>speech is not to talk about you but rather the subject matter. <br><br>An old saying is that small minds talk about things, average <br><br>minds talk about people, and great minds talk about ideas. <br><br>What you&#x2019;re selling is almost always an idea, even if it&#x2019;s painting <br><br>the house. The idea is the good appearance or the protection <br><br>of the house. The fishing-trip story is about the idea of <br><br>getting away and going after exciting game fish. One idea, well <br><br>developed, is the key. <br><br>A beautiful painting is put together by a thousand brushstrokes, <br><br>each stroke making a contribution to the main theme, <br><br>the overall picture. It&#x2019;s the same with a good speech. <br><br>When speakers&#x2014;especially inexperienced speakers&#x2014;prepare <br><br>a talk, their biggest fear is not having enough to say to fill the <br><br>allotted time. Most people worry that they&#x2019;ll run out of material <br><br>in the middle of their talk, but they respond to this fear in <br><br>a misguided way. They &#x201c;puff &#x201d; their presentation. They wind <br><br>up trying to cram the story of their lives into their fifteen minutes <br><br>at the podium. The presentation gets bigger, but instead <br><br>of really growing, it just swells. This is an especially dangerous <br><br>pitfall for new speakers since it&#x2019;s usually unconscious. The <br><br>principle of knowing what you&#x2019;re talking about doesn&#x2019;t mean <br><br>you have to say it all. You say just enough to fill your time effectively. <br><br>You leave your audience wanting more, and if you&#x2019;ve <br><br>truly mastered your subject, they&#x2019;ll know that there <i>is </i>more. <br><br>You&#x2019;ll project knowledge to them that&#x2019;s above and beyond your <br><br>actual spoken words. <br><br>To reach this level of mastery, you should begin preparing <br><br>ten days to two weeks before your event. Start your preparation <br><br>by sitting down with a pencil and paper for twenty minutes&#x2014; <br><br>no less and no more&#x2014;and writing at least fifty questions about <br><br>your topic. Fifty is the minimum, but you should definitely try <br><br>for as many as possible. Write your questions as quickly as you <br><br>can. Don&#x2019;t give them a lot of thought. That&#x2019;s why the twentyminute <br><br>time limit is important. This stage of preparation is a <br><br>sprint, not a leisurely stroll through your mental library. <br><br>During this twenty-minute session, you&#x2019;re creating an outline <br><br>for your talk&#x2014;and we want to stress the importance of <br><br>putting this in the form of questions. Research shows that this <br><br>is much more stimulating to the brain than a conventional outline, <br><br>and since you&#x2019;re not supplying answers at this point, it can <br><br>also be done much faster. The answers will come later in other <br><br>sessions leading up to your talk. <br><br>Let me repeat, your first session should be limited to twenty <br><br>minutes, and it should be done the old-fashioned way, with an <br><br>actual pencil and paper. <br><br>In your second session, you&#x2019;ll start supplying answers to <br><br>your questions and providing evidence for your ideas. This is <br><br>when the computer becomes an essential tool. Begin by creating <br><br>a document file of your questions&#x2014;there should be <i>at least <br><br></i>fifty&#x2014;and quickly writing an answer for each one based on <br><br>your own knowledge. Write this just as you would say it if you <br><br>were sitting in Starbucks with a good friend. Unlike your first <br><br>session, you don&#x2019;t have to limit yourself to twenty minutes, but <br><br>don&#x2019;t feel as if you have to answer all of your questions either. <br><br>Just keep at it until you feel your energy start to fade. Resist <br><br>the temptation to use the Internet to gather information. That <br><br>will come later. Right now your job is to access everything you <br><br>know about your topic, which is probably a lot more than you <br><br><i>think </i>you know. <br><br>It may take you several sessions to answer all the questions <br><br>you wrote down, but that&#x2019;s no problem as long as you begin <br><br>at least ten days in advance. Just make sure that you complete <br><br>your answers with three or four days left before your talk. In <br><br>those final sessions, you can surf the Internet for facts and <br><br>figures to enhance what you&#x2019;ve already written. Remember, <br><br>you don&#x2019;t have to report everything there is to know about <br><br>your topic. Ideally, you have total mastery of your subject, but <br><br>that&#x2019;s for your benefit as much as for the audience&#x2019;s. Mastery <br><br>allows you to feel completely confident in your role as an <br><br>authority. It&#x2019;s not something you have to demonstrate in the <br><br>actual words that come out of your mouth. So pick and choose <br><br>the pertinent and hard-hitting information that you want to <br><br>include. Think of your talk as a special meal you&#x2019;re preparing <br><br>in your home for some honored guests. Don&#x2019;t think of it as a <br><br>full service restaurant. <br><br>For some presentations you have little or no prior information. <br><br>Other times the opposite will be true. For example, <br><br>if you&#x2019;re talking about your own life or career, you&#x2019;ll have a <br><br>wealth of material on the subject. Your problem is to select <br><br>and arrange the information. Don&#x2019;t try to tell your audience <br><br>everything because it can&#x2019;t be done. Your talk will come off <br><br>as sketchy and fragmented. On the other hand, if you&#x2019;re talking <br><br>about something that&#x2019;s less familiar to you, avoid trying to <br><br>cover this up with excessive research. Be frank with yourself <br><br>and your audience about your relationship to the topic. You <br><br>don&#x2019;t have to say you feel ignorant about it, but you don&#x2019;t have <br><br>to pretend you&#x2019;re a total expert either. You might want to take <br><br>only one aspect of your topic and expand upon it. Don&#x2019;t make <br><br>your talk an abstraction. Make liberal use of illustrations, <br><br>personal observatio...</p><h2>Orpheus Descending and Suddenly Last Summer (New Directions Books)</h2><p><p><strong>Two of Tennessee Williams's most revered dramas in a single paperback edition for the first time.</strong></p><p><em>Orpheus Descending</em> is a love story, a plea for spiritual and artistic freedom, as well as a portrait of racism and intolerance. When charismatic drifter Valentine Xavier arrives in a Mississippi Delta town with his guitar and snakeskin jacket, he becomes a trigger for hatred and a magnet for three outcast souls: storekeeper Lady Torrance, &#x201c;lewd vagrant&#x201d; Carol Cutrere, and religious visionary Vee Talbot.</p><p><em>Suddenly Last Summer</em>, described by its author as a &#x201c;short morality play,&#x201d; has become one of his most notorious works due in no small part to the film version starring Elizabeth Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, and Montgomery Clift that shocked audiences in 1959. A menacing tale of madness, jealousy, and denial,the horrors in <em>Suddenly Last Summer</em> build to a heart-stopping conclusion.</p><p>With perceptive new introductions by playwright Martin Sherman &#x2015; he reframes <em>Orpheus Descending</em> in a political context and explores the psychology and sensationalism surrounding <em>Suddenly Last Summer</em> &#x2015; this volume also offers Williams&#x2019;s related essay, &#x201c;The Past, the Present, and the Perhaps,&#x201d; and a chronology of the playwright&#x2019;s life and works.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tennessee Williams</strong> (1911-1983) is the acclaimed author of many books of letters, short stories, poems, essays, and a large collection of plays, including <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>, <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, <em>Camino Real,</em><em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em>, <em>Orpheus Descending</em>, <em>The Night of the Iguana</em>, and <em>The Rose Tattoo</em>.</p><p>Dramatist Martin Sherman's plays have been produced in over 50 countries, and he has been nominated for two Tonys, two Oliviers, and two BAFTAS.</p></p><h2>Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America&#39;s Hoboes</h2><p>In Ted Conover's first book, now back in print, he enters a segment of humanity outside society and reports back on a world few of us would chose to enter but about which we are all curious.<br><br>Hoboes fascinated Conover, but he had only encountered them in literature and folksongs. So, he decided to take a year off and ride the rails. Equipped with rummage-store clothing, a bedroll, and a few other belongings, he hops a freight train in St. Louis, becoming a tramp in order to discover their peculiar culture. The men and women he meets along the way are by turns generous and mistrusting, resourceful and desperate, philosophical and profoundly cynical. And the narrative he creates of his travels with them is unforgettable and moving.</p><p>Ted Conover is the author most recently of the National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee<b><i> </i>Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing</b><i>.</i> He lives in New York City.The tramp travels, and he works, Conover was told while riding the rails. "The hobo, he travels, but he don't work. Just likes drifting. The bum ain't gonna do nothing, work or travel." An anthropology major, Conover spent five dollars on thrift-shop clothes and jumped a freight. Before he was done, he'd jumped 65 of them, slept in hobo jungles, and been jailed for asking to see a policeman's badge number. He even worked in the fields and gave blood for money. That was more than twenty years ago, but there's a new preface, and Conover still sounds like himself, a keen observer with in-fectious innocence and a yen for social justice.

In 1916 she married Major James Reid Peploe (nephew to the artist Samuel Peploe). After the First World War they lived near Glasgow and brought up two sons and a daughter. Dorothy wrote her first novel in the 1920&#39;s, and by the 1930&#39;s was a prolific bestseller, ultimately selling more than seven million books in her career. Among her many bestselling novels was the series featuring the popular &#34;Mrs. Tim&#34;, the wife of a British Army officer. The author often returned to Scotland and Scottish themes in her romantic, witty and well-observed novels. During the Second World War Dorothy Stevenson moved with her husband to Moffat in Scotland. It was here that most of her subsequent works were written. D.E. Stevenson died in Moffat in 1973.</p><h2>Taunton&#39;s Complete Illustrated Guide to Tablesaws (Complete Illustrated Guides (Taunton))</h2><p><p><strong>From the most basic techniques to the most advanced procedures, here's the ultimate owner's manual for anyone who uses a tablesaw.</strong></p> <p><strong>Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user,</strong> you'll find all the valuable tips and step-by-step advice you need to master ripping, crosscutting, joint making, and shaping.

On a sunny afternoon. Mel and I hate sunny afternoons. Especially here in Misery Saga, which is what you&#x2019;re allowed to call Mississauga if you live there. In Misery Saga, there is nothing to do with sunny afternoons but all the things we have already done a thousand times. We&#x2019;ve lain on our backs in the grass, listening to the same discman, one earphone each, watching the same clouds pass. We&#x2019;ve walked in the woodlot pretending to pretend that it is Wonderland, even though when you stand in the heart of it, you can still hear cars drive by. We&#x2019;ve eaten dry cupcakes at that dessert place down the road where all the other kids go. We don&#x2019;t like other kids but we went anyway, just for the bustle. We&#x2019;ve sat behind the bleachers sharing Blizzards from Dairy Queen, the wind making our Catholic school kilts flap against our stubbly knees. Our favorite was the one with the pulverized brownies and nuts and chocolate sauce, but they don&#x2019;t make it anymore for some reason. So we&#x2019;re at the McDonald&#x2019;s on the corner eating McFlurries, which everyone knows aren&#x2019;t as good as Blizzards, even when you tell them to mix more things in.</p><p>We&#x2019;re bored out of our minds as usual, having exhausted every topic of conversation. There is only so much Mel and I can say about the girls we hate or the bands and books we love on a scale of one to ten. There is only so much we can play of The Human Race Game, which is when we eliminate the whole human race and only put back in the people we can stand and only if we both agree. There is only so much we can talk about how we&#x2019;d give it up and what we&#x2019;d be wearing and with which boy and what he&#x2019;d be wearing and what album might be playing in the background. We&#x2019;ve established, for the second time today, that for Mel it would be a red velvet dress, the drummer from London After Midnight, Renaissance wear, and Violator. For me: a purple velvet dress, Vince Merino, a vintage suit, and Let Love In, but it changes.</p><p>So we decide to do The Fate Papers. The Fate Papers is Mel&#x2019;s name for when you tear off two small bits of paper and write No on one piece and Yes on the other. You shake the two balled up pieces in your hands while you close your eyes and ask the universe your question. You can ask aloud or in your mind. Mel and I both prefer in your mind but sometimes, if it is an urgent matter, like now, we ask aloud. The first paper that drops is the answer. Now we are asking if Mel should call Eric to see if he likes the CD she made him of her favorite Lee Hazlewood songs. The Fate Papers already said No, but we&#x2019;re doing two out of three because that couldn&#x2019;t be right even though The Fate Papers are never wrong. Next, we are going to ask if I should try talking to Vince Merino again after yesterday&#x2019;s fiasco attempt.</p><p>The Fate Papers say No to Mel again, then No to me.</p><p>The universe is against us, which makes sense. So we get another McFlurry and talk about how fat we are for a while. But it doesn&#x2019;t matter how long we talk about it, or how many times Mel assures me she&#x2019;s a fucking whale beneath her clothes, I know I&#x2019;m fatter. Not by a little either. Mel has an ass, I&#x2019;ll give her that, but that&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ll give her.</p><p>If I win the fat argument then Mel will say, so what I&#x2019;m way prettier than she is but I think face-wise we&#x2019;re about the same. I haven&#x2019;t really grown into my nose yet or discovered the arts of starving myself and tweezing. So I&#x2019;ll be honest with you. In this story, I don&#x2019;t look that good, except for maybe my skin which Mel claims she would kill for. Also my tits. Mel says they&#x2019;re huge and she assures me it&#x2019;s a good thing. Maybe even too much of a good thing, she says. It&#x2019;s Mel who got me using the word tits. I have trouble calling them anything even in my thoughts. They embarrass me and all the words for them embarrass me, but I&#x2019;m trying, for Mel&#x2019;s sake, to name my assets. Even with my tits, though, it&#x2019;s still Mel who looks better. She&#x2019;s got psoriasis and a mustache she has to bleach (we both do) and still. It&#x2019;s definitely Mel who has any hope in hell with any of the boys we like. Which is I guess why she claims the men at the next table were looking at her first.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t even noticed them. I was busy eating my Oreo McFlurry, hunting for the larger pieces of Oreo that sometimes got trapped at the bottom, which I hate. It&#x2019;s Mel who points the men out saying three o clock to me without moving her lips or making much noise. I turn and see three businessmen sitting in the booth next to us, eating Big Macs. I assume they are businessmen because they are wearing business suits but they could just as easily have been suit salesmen or bank tellers. At any rate, they are men, their hands full of veins and hairs, each pair of hands gripping a bit-into Big Mac.</p><p>Mel said they were totally checking her out. I look at them again and none of them seem to be looking at us. They don&#x2019;t even seem to be looking at each other. They&#x2019;re looking at their burgers or into space.</p><p>No, Mel said. They were looking at her tits. Mel is exceedingly proud of her tits. What she loves most is the mole on the top of her left breast. She wears Wonderbras and low-cut tops to show it off.</p><p>I want a boob guy, she always tells me. I wouldn&#x2019;t want a butt guy because I hate my butt.</p><p>Yeah, I say, in sympathy.</p><p>I hate it, she clarifies. But boys love it. They always give me compliments. Still, I wouldn&#x2019;t want a butt guy. He&#x2019;d always want to do it from behind.</p><p>Yeah, I would say, in sympathy again. We both agree we&#x2019;d never want a leg guy.</p><p>The reason the men were looking, according to Mel, was because she&#x2019;d been giving off sex vibes all day. I never know what she means by this. My best guess is something between an animal scent and a cosmic force. Mel always says it had to do with the universe. What happens is the universe feels her sex vibes and transmits them to other like-minded men and women. Mel says these particular men could feel her sex vibes. That&#x2019;s why they looked. She was giving off enough of them for both of us. Which is why they looked at me too. They&#x2019;re totally checking us both out, she says. They checked her out first, of course. But now they&#x2019;re checking us both out.</p><p>I say, Really?</p><p>And she says, Totally. Doesn&#x2019;t that make you horny?</p><p>I hate the word horny. It makes me think of sweat and snorting and wiry hairs.</p><p>I guess, I say. Though it really, really doesn&#x2019;t. The men aren&#x2019;t really attractive. I mean they&#x2019;re fine I guess. But they have these little blinky businessmen eyes and one of them even has grey hair. They look like they are around my father&#x2019;s age. I hardly see my father since he left, but I know he has a lot of girlfriends. Mainly women he works with at the hotel where he&#x2019;s a manager. I find traces of them with on my infrequent visits to his apartment&#x2014;feathery, complicated lingerie between his balled up black socks, a box of tampons under the sink. And then in with his cologne bottles shaped like male torsos, I&#x2019;ll find a perfume that smells sickly sweet. One time one of them left a message on the machine saying she missed his body oh so much. I can&#x2019;t even imagine missing my father&#x2019;s body and not just because he is my father. No, none of this was making me especially horny. But I say it sort of is because I know if I don&#x2019;t play along Mel will be angry and a pain to hang out with.</p><p>Wouldn&#x2019;t it be fun, she says, if we went up to them and propositioned them?</p><p>To do what? I say.</p><p>To like, I don&#x2019;t know, she sighs. Let us suck them off. For money. I&#x2019;d say we&#x2019;re each worth at least fifty bucks. Maybe even a hundred.</p><p>Mel&#x2019;s a bit of slut. But you can&#x2019;t ever call her that. She hates the word slut and gets pissed if anybody around her uses it. She got super pissed at our friend Katherine once, this girl at our school who wants to be a nun, because Katherine says slut about people she doesn&#x2019;t like and she says it, according to Mel, with a mouth full of hate. I tell Mel what does she expect from a girl who only wants to be touched by the hand of God? Mel says it doesn&#x2019;t matter and really hates Katherine even though we&#x2019;re all friends.</p><p>Mel had to change schools even because they kept calling her a slut. Mostly behind her back, but sometimes even to her face like in an 80s movie. Something about a boy she really liked who already had a girlfriend but the boy found out Mel liked him and started to like her back without breaking up with his girlfriend. So when Mel found out the boy liked her back, she gave him a blow job in the woodlot. But then his girlfriend found out about it and got everyone in the school to start calling Mel a slut whenever she walked by. I guess the boy must have felt guilty about the blow job and decided to tell his girlfriend. Or he was proud of it and just couldn&#x2019;t stop himself. Whatever it was, Mel couldn&#x2019;t take it and had to change schools. That&#x2019;s how I met her and we started getting bored together.</p><p>People call Mel a slut at our school too. Because of what she wears on days when we don&#x2019;t wear our uniforms but also because of what she wears on regular days which is nylon thigh highs instead of the itchy wooly tights we&#x2019;re supposed to wear. And she rolls her kilt all the way up so you can see where the thigh highs end. My mother thinks this is why people call Mel a slut. But I don&#x2019;t think so. Not to sound like an old fart, but you should see girls these days. Some girls roll their kilts all the way up to their crotch. I wear mine down to my knees, but sometimes I&#x2019;ll roll it up just a little on the way to school. But then it always rolls back down by itself. It&#x2019;s fine. Later on I&#x2019;m going to be really fucking beautiful. I&#x2019;m going to grow into that nose and develop an eating disorder. I&#x2019;ll be hungry and angry all of my life but I&#x2019;ll also have a hell of a time.</p><p>For minutes now, Mel has been seriously calculating how much we might be worth to these businessmen. She has now decided that our youth and the fact that we&#x2019;re both virgins&#x2014;in her case, only technically&#x2014;makes us way more expensive than she initially thought.</p><p>At least 300 dollars, she finally said. What do you think?</p><p>At the very, very least, I say, playing along. I try to use a voice that tells her I&#x2019;m just playing along.</p><p>I look at the men more closely. Two are fine. But one of them is rather flabby and pale with little worm husk lips and a look of hunger in his eyes that his Big Mac is not filling. His whole face reminds me of the word horny. I know if it comes to down to it, this is the one I&#x2019;ll get stuck with.</p><p>But where are we going to go with these guys? I ask.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll bet one of them&#x2019;s got a big, black car, Mel says. Big enough for all of us.</p><p>Mel looks out the Windex-streaked window into the parking lot. I look with her.</p><p>There are no cars like that in the parking lot.</p><p>There&#x2019;s more parking in back, Mel says.</p><p>She says, You go ask them.</p><p>You go, I say. It&#x2019;s your idea.</p><p>She looks at me and takes a deep breath and says Okay and gets up and I say, Wait.</p><p>What?</p><p>Let&#x2019;s go to the bathroom first.</p><p>When we get up to go to the bathroom, Mel saunters up to the three men and says Hey in what she thinks is her sexiest voice. To me, though, the only difference between it and her normal voice is that it just sounds louder. In this voice, she asks them if they might happen to know the time.</p><p>All three of these men are wearing wristwatches but only one of them&#x2014;the fat, pale, horny one&#x2014;consults his. The other two exchange a glance and keep eating.</p><p>It&#x2019;s about 5:30, he says, looking up at us. And I notice that when he does, his little businessman eyes do this little dip from our faces to our chests. It&#x2019;s the littlest dip you can imagine. But it&#x2019;s all Mel can talk about when we get to the bathroom.</p><p>Could you beeelieeeeve that guy? I mean, he was slobbering all ohhhver us.</p><p>And I say, Totally, I know. He totally was.</p><p>And she says, Oh my god, Lizzie, we have to do this.</p><p>And I agree. We have to.</p><p>It was Dress Down Day, which means that though we came from school, we&#x2019;re not wearing our uniforms. This Dress Down Day had a theme. Normally Mel and I steer clear of the themes because of how lame they usually are, but this one was The Sixties which we guessed was cool enough. Everybody dressed up like a hippie including me but Mel did something cooler. She found this mini dress with a whacked out red and white pattern at Value Village for like seven bucks. So she&#x2019;s wearing that and her lips are covered with a silvery frost which she is now reapplying in the mirror. Her eyelids are lined thickly on top with black liquid liner. All day she got compliments from everyone, even though we know no one except Katherine. Girls we both hate kept coming up to Mel and saying things like, Love your dress. And then Mel said, Thanks, and when the girl was out of ear shot Mel finished with Bitch. And we both laughed.</p><p>I finish putting on my lipstick and I watch Mel apply a fresh coat of eyeliner to one closed eye, and I say But we can&#x2019;t have sex with them.</p><p>Mel waves the coat of eyeliner dry with a hand.</p><p>Oh my god, she says, of course not. Are you crazy?</p><p>I heave a sigh of relief. Okay good, I say.</p><p>We&#x2019;re just going to suck them off in their car, she says. It&#x2019;ll like make their whole lives.</p><p>Alright, I say, and run my tongue over my teeth.</p><p>I pray the businessmen won&#x2019;t be there when we get back, but they&#x2019;re there. And one of them, our friend, the time-teller, even smiles at us. Mel takes a step toward their table; they all look up. Then just as she takes a breath and starts to open her mouth, I grab her hand and pull her back.</p><p>What? She hisses.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s do The Fate Papers real quick, I hiss back.</p><p>Mel sighs and sits down with me back at our booth.</p><p>I watch as she lamely shuffles the crumbled bits of napkin. I close my eyes tight and ask the universe as hard I can in my mind.</p><p>When the paper drops, I pick it up off the table and unfold it.</p><p>Yes, written with purple ink in Mel&#x2019;s loopy hand.</p><p>I make her do two out of three.</p><p>Now what? she says, as we both stare the crumpled Yes of the universe in the face for the second time.</p><p>By then the businessmen are getting up, clearing their trays. The horny one, though, he takes his time, smiling at me on the way out in a manner that I can only describe as trying for fatherly but coming off more like a creepy uncle. Mel and I look at each other and make a face and fake a shudder and laugh.</p><p>Later on, Mel would climb into cars and taxis with men she barely knew while I watched from the sidewalk. She would agree to blow a guy in the stall of a men&#x2019;s bathroom near Union Station for fifty dollars.. She would wear her Catholic school uniform long after she had dropped out of high school for a man from Sudbury who looked exactly like Sloth from The Goonies.</p><p>Much later on, in the back of a parked van, my wrists would get tied together with a pair of dirty gym socks and I would get terrible head from a political science major who would tell me my inability to come was psychological. I would go to a park with a man ten years ...</p></p><h2>Guilt (Abe Glitsky)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A great thriller: breakneck pacing, electrifying courtroom scenes, and a cast of richly crafted characters.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>People</i></b><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Mark Dooher is a prosperous San Francisco attorney and a prominent Catholic, the last person anyone would suspect of a brutal crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dooher, a paragon of success and a master of all he touches, is about to be indicted for murder.<br><br>Charged with savagely killing his own wife, Dooher is fighting for his reputation and his life in a high-profile case that is drawing dozens of lives into its wake&#x2014;from former spouses to former friends, from a beautiful, naive young attorney to a defense lawyer whose own salvation depends on getting his client off.<br><br>Now, as the trial builds to a crescendo, as evidence is sifted and witnesses discredited, as a good cop tries to pick up the pieces of his shattered life and a D.A. risks her career, the truth about Mark Dooher is about to explode.&nbsp;&nbsp;For in a trial that will change the lives of everyone it touches, there is one thing that no one knows&#x2014;until it is much too late. . . .<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>Guilt</i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;A well-paced legal thriller . .&nbsp; . one of the best in this flourishing genre to come along in a while.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Begin [<i>Guilt</i>] over a weekend . . .

A complex, impressive exploration of obsession and desire." -<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</b> <br> In this stunning and powerful debut, a girl with no name embarks on a fraught three-way relationship with Matt, a Satanist and a tattoo artist, and his girlfriend Frances, a new mom. The liaison is caged by strict rules and rigid emotional distance. Nonetheless, it&#x2019;s all too easy to surrender to an attraction so powerful she finds herself erased, abandoning even her own name in favor of a new one: Lilith. <br><br>As Lilith grows closer to Matt, she begins to recognize the dark undertow of obsession and jealousy that her presence has created between Matt and Frances, and finds herself balancing on a knife&#x2019;s edge between pain and pleasure, the promise of the future and the crushing isolation of the present.

Soon after, he built the first flying platform and was able to duplicate the UFO's tilt-to-control maneuvers. Official policy, however, prevented him from proclaiming his findings. "I was destined," says Hill, "to be as unidentified as the flying objects."</p><p>For the next twenty-five years, Hill acted as an unofficial clearinghouse at NASA, collecting and analyzing sightings' reports for physical properties, propulsion possibilities, dynamics, etc. To refute claims that UFOs defy the laws of physics, he had to make "technological sense... of the unconventional object."</p><p>After his retirement from NASA, Hill finally completed his remarkable analysis. This book, published posthumously, presents his findings that UFOs "obey, not defy, the laws of physics." Vindicating his own sighting and thousands of others, he proves that UFO technology is not only explainable, but attainable.</p></p><p><b>Paul Richard Hill</b> (1909-1990) was an American aerodynamicist.

As president of the high-profile Ventura charter of the club, he had been the yin to Sonny Barger&#x2019;s yang. Barger was the reckless figurehead and de facto world leader of the Hells Angels. Christie was the negotiator, the spokesman, the thinker, the guy who smoothed things out. He was the one who carried the Olympic torch and counted movie stars, artists, rock musicians, and police chief captains among his friends.</p><p>But leaving the Hells Angels isn&#x2019;t easy, and within two weeks of retirement, he was told he was &#x201c;out bad&#x201d;&#x2015;blackballed by his fellow Angels, prohibited from wearing the club patch, and even told he should remove his Death Head tattoo.</p><p>Now Christie sets out to tell his story. <i>Exile on Front Street</i> is the tale of how a former Marine gave up a comfortable job with the Department of Defense and swore allegiance to the Hells Angels. In this revealing, hard-hitting memoir, he recounts his life as an outlaw biker with the world&#x2019;s most infamous motorcycle club.</p></p><p>GEORGE CHRISTIE served as a Marine reservist and, after completing his service, became an electrician and communications troubleshooter for the Department of Defense. He prospected for the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in 1975, becoming a full-patch member in 1976, eventually founding the Ventura charter and serving as its president for more than thirty years. He also served as the club&#x2019;s international spokesman for more than two decades. He lives in Ojai, California."Christie articulately defends his outlaw code, which he adhered to at great personal cost.

Many episodes later cut for the sake of good novelistic form, especially autobiographical episodes of sensual and family life, are fully presented, with some of the most vivacious dialogue Joyce ever wrote.

According to Rowbotham's scientific method, which he called Zetetic Astronomy, the earth is a flat disk centered at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, with the sun, moon, planets, and stars only a few hundred miles above the surface of the earth.<br><br>Rowbotham and his followers gained notoriety by engaging in raucous public debates with leading scientists of the day.

I have since read every book she&#39;s ever written, many of them multiple times. As a young teenager, I looked to the heroines (who are always young women facing difficult situations with courage, grace and intelligence) as role models on how to become a woman. I love the mix of exotic locals, mystery and romance in Mary Stewart&#39;s novels.Lovely Vanessa March did not think it was a strange for her husband to take a business trip to Stockholm. What was strange was the silence that followed. Then she caught a glimpse of him in a newsreel shot of a crowd near a mysterious circus fire in Vienna and knew it was more than strange. It was downright sinister.<p>Once again Mary Stewart unfolds a masterpiece of intrigue, terror, and suspense in this headlong-paced tale of a young wife's search for a missing husband....</p></p><h2>Heaven&#39;s Command</h2><p>Jan Morris tells the epic story of the rise of the British Empire, from Queen Victoria&#39;s accession in 1837 to her Diamond Jubilee in 1897. In this celebrated masterwork she vividly evokes every aspect of the &#39;great adventure&#39;, ranging from ships and botanical gardens to hill stations and sugar plantations, as she subtly traces the impact of empire on places as diverse as Sierra Leone and Fiji, Zululand and the Canadian prairies.</p><p>Jan Morris was born in 1926 of a Welsh father and an English mother, and when she is not travelling she lives with her partner Elizabeth Morris in the top left-hand corner of Wales, between the mountains and the sea. Her books include <i>Coronation Everest</i>, <i>Venice</i>, <i>The Pax Britannica Trilogy </i>(<i>Heaven's Command</i>, <i>Pax Britannica</i>, and <i>Farewell the Trumpets</i>), and <i>Conundrum</i>. She is also the author of six books about cities and countries, two autobiographical books, several volumes of collected travel essays and, more recently, the unclassifiable <i>Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere</i>. <i>A Writer's World</i>, a collection of her travel writing and reportage from over five decades, was published in 2003. <i>Hav, </i>her novel, was published in a new and expanded form in 2006 and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Arthur C.

Translated by Giovanni Pontiero.<br></p><p>Joana Carda scratches the ground with an elm branch and the mute dogs of Cerbere begin to bark, portending doom. The earth cracks open and the Iberian peninsula separates from Europe and floats off into the Atlantic. The people flee the coastal areas in a mass exodus, to wander, disoriented, across the floating, spinning island&#39;s interior. Among them are a group of strangers who wind up in the home of Maria Guavaira: Joaquim Sassa, who threw a stone into the sea and then found himself in Maria&#39;s bed; Joana Carda, who cut the earth in two; Jose Anaico, the king of the starlings; Pedro Orce, who can make the earth tremble with his feet; and a dog with no name and every name. At once an epic adventure and a timely political fable about the vicissitudes of the European Community, The Stone Raft is a narrative tour de force.<p>JOS� SARAMAGO (1922&#x2013;2010) was the author of many novels, among them <i>Blindness, All the Names, Baltasar&nbsp;and Blimunda,</i> and <i>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.</i> In 1998 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p></p><h2>Paul and Union with Christ: An Exegetical and Theological Study</h2><p>Winner of the Christianity Today 2014 Book Award in Biblical Studies, Paul and Union with Christ fills the gap for biblical scholars, theologians, and pastors pondering and debating the meaning of union with Christ. Following a selective survey of the scholarly work on union with Christ through the twentieth century to the present day, Greek scholar Constantine Campbell carefully examines every occurrence of the phrases &#39;in Christ&#39;, &#39;with Christ&#39;, &#39;through Christ&#39;, &#39;into Christ,&#39; and other related expressions, exegeting each passage in context and taking into account the unique lexical contribution of each Greek preposition. Campbell then builds a holistic portrayal of Paul&#39;s thinking and engages contemporary theological discussions about union with Christ by employing his evidence-based understanding of the theme. This volume combines high-level scholarship and a concern for practical application of a topic currently debated in the academy and the church. More than a monograph, this book is a helpful reference tool for students, scholars, and pastors to consult its treatment of any particular instance of any phrase or metaphor that relates to union with Christ in the Pauline corpus.</p><p>Constantine R. Campbell (PhD, Macquarie University) is Associate Professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. He is author of Paul and Union with Christ, Outreach and the Artist, Verbal Aspect, the Indicative Mood, and Narrative, Verbal Aspect and Non-Indicative Verbs, Not Ashamed, Basics of Verbal Aspect in Biblical Greek, and Keep Your Greek. Dr Campbell is a public speaker, musician, and author, and lives in Chicago."For years I have taught students that one of the most important items in Paul's theological vocabulary is the two-letter word<i> en</i>, despite the failure of so many writers to pick it up. Now at last there is a comprehensive study that pays attention to the use of <i>en</i> and related terms in the whole of the Pauline corpus and incorporates the insights of contemporary scholarship. This is a valuable reference work for all students of New Testament theology."&nbsp;<br> - I. Howard Marshall,&nbsp;Professor Emeritus of New Testament, University of Aberdeen<br><br>"At the heart of debate over several important theological issues, not least justification, stands a unifying theme: union with Christ. That theme almost everyone espouses but interprets differently or with remarkable vagueness. The strength of Con Campbell's book is his patient examination of the controlling expressions--what it means to be 'in Christ,' for example. Here there is no reductionism, but sure-footed guidance through the biblical evidence and sensible, even-handed, conclusions. Highly recommended."<br>- D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"Rarely do New Testament scholars and theologians seem interested in the same thing at the same time, although until this volume the latter have done the lion's share of monograph-style treatments. Holding up the diamond, Professor Campbell explores each facet.&nbsp;Although readers may not agree with all of the conclusions, <i>Paul and Union with Christ</i> is a crucial resource for exegetical reflection and precision on such an important topic."<br>- Michael Horton, Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>"With the increased prominence of attention to&nbsp;union with Christ in Paul in recent decades, Campbell's contribution is most welcome.&nbsp;Impressive for its comprehensive scope,&nbsp;its careful attention to exegetical detail yet with the overall theological picture also&nbsp;in view, and its balanced and fair conclusions, this book is bound to benefit anyone interested in this important topic."<br>- Richard B. Gaffin Jr.,&nbsp;Professor of Biblical and Systematic Theology, Emeritus, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia<br><br>"Campbell provides a lucid and lively study of union with Christ. Few authors are able to combine exegetical skill with theological acumen on such a complex topic as Campbell does here. It is a brilliant study about what a constellation of images of union, participation, identification, and incorporation into Christ actually means. Campbell's <i>tour de force</i> will be the authoritative book on the subject for decades to come."<br>- Michael F. Bird,&nbsp;Lecturer in Theology and New Testament, Crossway College in Brisbane, Australia</p><h2>The View From Rat Lake</h2><p>Brilliant, witty, perceptive essays about fly-fishing, the natural world, and life in general by the acknowledged master of fishing writers.<br><br>&#x201c;In the world of fishing there are magic phrases that are guaranteed to summon the demon. Among them are: &#x2018;remote trout lake,&#x2019; &#x2018;fish up to 13 pounds,&#x2019; &#x2018;the place the guides fish on their days off,&#x2019;&#x201d; writes John Gierach in this wonderful collection of thirteen essays inspired by a fishing trip to Rat Lake, a remote body of water in Montana. Once again John Gierach does what he does best&#x2014;explain the peculiarities of the fishing life in a way that will amuse novices and seasoned fly fishers alike. <i>The View from Rat Lake</i> deftly examines man in nature and nature in man, the pleasures of fishing the high country, and the high and low comedy that occasionally overcomes even the best-planned fishing trip. <br><br>Some typically sage observations from <i>The View from Rat Lake</i>: <br><br>&#x201c;One of the things we truly fish for [is] an occasion for self-congratulation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In every catch-and-release fisherman&#x2019;s past there is an old black frying pan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We . . . believe that a 12-inch trout caught on a dry fly is four inches longer than a 12-inch trout caught on a nymph or streamer.&#x201d;</p><p>John Gierach is the author of&nbsp;more than twenty books about fly-fishing. His writing has appeared in&nbsp;<i>Field &amp; Stream, Gray&#x2019;s Sporting Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fly Rod &amp; Reel</i>, where he is a regular columnist. He also writes a column for the monthly&nbsp;<i>Redstone Review</i>. He lives in Lyons, Colorado.&nbsp;For devotees of fly fishing, this collection of 13 congenial essays takes readers to prime locations for the sport in the western U.S., including lesser-known streams and lakes. Gierach (Trout Bum) introduces certain innovations like the "fishing car," used only to transport anglers to their quarry, and with wit assesses the snobbery of "purist" fly-fishers. Along with relating his personal fishing successes, he explains differing practices in the sport occasioned by seasonal changesfor example, ice fishingand defines what constitutes a "big catch," be it trout or bass. Beyond Gierach's evocative descriptions of the angler's anticipation when on the water, the book is flavored by arch humor that suggests the author doesn't take fishing as seriously as he pretends. But he is clearly having a good time here, and readers are likely to share his enjoyment. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Voice of the Eagle: The Heart of Celtic Christianity: John Scotus Eriugena&#x2019;s Homily on the Prologue to the Gospel of St. John</h2><p><b>Includes John Scotus Eriugena's "Homily on the Prologue to the Gospel of St. John"</b><br><br>John Scotus Eriugena was born and raised in Ireland during the early ninth century. Neither monk nor priest but a "holy sage," he carried to France the flower of Celtic Christianity. His homily, <i>The Voice of the Eagle</i>, is a jewel of lyrical mysticism, theology, and cosmology, containing the essence of Celtic Christian wisdom. He meditates on the meaning and purpose of creation as revealed by the Word made flesh, distilling into twenty-three short chapters a uniquely Celtic, non-dualistic fusion of Christianity, Platonism, and ancient Irish wisdom. <br><br>The translator's "Reflections" make up the second half of this book and attempt to unfold some of the life-giving meaning implicit in Eriugena's luminous sentences. Inspired both by a personal search for a living Christianity and by a sense of the continuity of Western culture, these "Reflections" offer a contemporary, meditative encounter with the Word, or Logos, as mediated by both St. John's Prologue and Eriugena's Celtic homily. This favorite of Celtic Christianity, unavailable for several years, has been revised and includes a new foreword by Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul and The Soul of Sex</i>.<br><br><br>"Christopher Bamford has written a wonderful book. It combines a rigor of scholarship with a lyrical unveiling of how this wonderful text of Eriugena's can resonate with the hungers and discoveries of our times. It deserves a wide readership. Its lucid depths enrich the mind and awaken the heart to the grandeur of light where the eternal shines." &#x2015;<b> John O'Donohue</b> is the author of<i> Anam Cara: A Book of Celtic Wisdom</i><br><br>"The book has been made with broad scholarship, with deep understanding and with love, and will be not quickly used up; one returns to it again and again. It will be cherished by anyone who is thirsty for the water of wisdom that has flowed so abundantly from the spring of Christ." &#x2015;<b> Bruno Barnhart</b> is the author of <i>Second Simplicity: The Inner Shape of Christianity </i><br><br>"Eriugena is increasingly recognized as one of the most penetrating spiritual masters of the Christian tradition. The Homily he wrote on the Prologue to the Gospel of St John is the clearest summary of his thought about the role of the Divine Logos in cosmology and anthropology and provides the best introduction to his thought. In The Voice of the Eagle, Christopher Bamford presents an accurate and readable translation of this classic of Christian thought and suggests valuable comments about its meaning. &#x2015;<b>Bernard McGinn</b>, Naomi Shenstone Donnelly Professor, University of Chicago Author of <i>The Presence of God: A History of Western Mysticism</i><br><br>"The Prologue of St John's Gospel is so important that it was once read at the conclusion of every Catholic Mass. Eriugena's Homily on it, here translated, is a masterpiece. More accessible than his larger works, it helps to plunge us into the depths of the Word revealed in the Gospel. Christopher Bamford's extended and erudite commentary draws on the great contemplative writers of the Christian tradition of East and West to produce a text whose impact and importance grows the more it is read. The recovery of the Christian tradition, as he writes, "is a task of intuition, interpretation, and meditation."For many readers, that recovery will be nourished and assisted by this fascinating book." &#x2015;<b>Stratford Caldecott</b>, Center for Faith and Culture, Westminster College, Oxford<br><br>"... a precious gift for all of us who need to be touched anew by the truth of the Christian teaching" &#x2015;<b>Jacob Needleman</b>, author of <i>A Little Book on Love and Money and the Meaning of Life</i><br><br>"... a profound and transformative experience." - <b>John Carey</b>, former editor of <i>Gnosis Magazine</i><br><br> "Eriugena's Christian Neoplationism, untrammeled by the problems of later medieval thought, breathes with a freshness and shines with a light that could enrich authentic Christian thought today....a lovely and illuminating book." &#x2015;<b> Geddes MacGregor</b>, author of <i>Angels: Ministers of Grace</i></p><p><b>Christopher Bamford</b> is Editor in Chief for SteinerBooks and its imprints.

These two themes were recognized by the Second Vatican Council especially in the two constitutions "On the Church" and "The Church in the Modern World." <br><p>Von Balthasar's "bastions" are barriers erected over the centuries which separated the laity from the clergy and the Church from the world. He pleads for a Church that interprets "the signs of the age," grasps them and answers them, allowing herself to be awakened by the Holy Spirit and by the age "from the bed of historical sleep for the dead of today." The new function of the Church is to be the "yeast of the world"--she must understand herself as the "instrument of the mediation of salvation to the world." Stressing that the hour of the laity is sounding in the Church, von Balthasar makes it clear that the "true program of the Church for today is: the most powerful radiance into the world through the most immediate imitation of Christ."</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Somebody Owes Me Money (Hard Case Crime Novels)</h2><p>SOMETIMES WINNING FEELS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE LOSING.<br><br>Cab driver Chet Conway was hoping for a good tip from his latest fare, the sort he could spend.

This tip isn&#x2019;t spare change but inside dope on a long-shot horse. Chet, who likes both stud poker and horse racing, places a bet on the cuff, and the nag comes in big. But when he goes to collect, his bookie is bleeding. Even worse, everyone&#x2014;from the bookie&#x2019;s wife and sister, to the cops, to two warring gangs&#x2014;thinks Chet pulled the trigger. All he wants is his cash, but he looks likely to be paid in lead. This 1969 comic caper may have fallen out of print, but it&#x2019;s so agreeably engaging that it suggests that Westlake has never had a bad day at work. Chet&#x2019;s doggedness in the face of absurd complications keeps us smiling along in the backseat. And, even as Westlake kids the conventions of mystery, the neatly knotted plot proves that he takes even fun seriously. --Keir Graff</p><h2>My Life With The Spirits: The Adventures of a Modern Magician</h2><p>A rare glimpse into the fascinating, sometimes terrifying, sometimes hilarious world of a modern ceremonial magician. Hailed by critics as the most entertaining author and one of the most widely respected members of the magick community, Lon Milo DuQuette provides a beacon for aspiring magicians everywhere.</p><p>The first time I met Monsieur DuQuette, at a booksellers' convention in Los Angeles, he read my fortune with tarot cards. I was about to move, he predicted. Irritated, I huffed "that was ridiculous," I'd just moved into my boyfriend's house. When I arrived home from the convention, my aforementioned boyfriend told me he'd had a change of heart and would I please move out as soon as possible! The next time I sat down with DuQuette, at the same conference (several years later in Chicago), he regaled me with witticisms and stories. I was struck by his sincerity, self-revelation, and personable nature. This is the first time a true magician has written an autobiography since <i>The Confessions of Aleister Crowley</i>, and it's the next best thing to being able to sit with the charming and adept DuQuette. It's intimate, straightforward, and neither self-deprecating or egotistical. It contains excruciatingly honest revelations by a contemporary individual attempting to understand the universe and how it works. Here's a man who comfortably accepts himself and urges the reader to do the same. If you are not interested in magick, think of this as a fascinating autobiography. If you are, it's required reading. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>Not since The Confessions of Aleister Crowley has a true magician told his own story. My Life with the Spirits is a rare glimpse into the fascinating, sometimes terrifying, sometimes hilarious world of a modern ceremonial magician. Hailed by critics as the most entertaining author in the field and one of the most widely respected members of the magick community, Lon Milo DuQuette gently draws you into the introspective world of the modern magician, tickles you with hilarious observations and self-effacing confessions, then (often in the same paragraph) slams you in the heart with breathtaking profundities.<p>DuQuette's most impressive quality is that in spite of his many accomplishments he doesn't take himself too seriously, which makes what he has to say all the more appealing. He's been through experiences that many Americans can relate to from his "agonizing years of Sunday School" and service as an altar boy, to riding the waves of the cultural revolution of the 60s. After sorting through an abundance of spiritual paths, he finally came upon one that resonated with him. By shedding light on his own development -- as a person and a magician -- DuQuette provides a beacon for aspiring magicians everywhere.</p></p><h2>Christian Archetype, The (Studies in Jungian Psychology by Jungian Analysts)</h2><p>This book presents a much-need psychological interpretation of images and events central to the Christian myth, which may be understood symbolically in terms of the individuation of modern men and women. <br><br>The process of individuation, when it befalls a person, may lead to salvation or calamity.

Bowen, PhD, NCSP, school psychologist, Canyons School District, Utah<br><br> "McConaughy masterfully integrates theories and concepts concerning clinical interviewing into this engaging practitioner guide. Strengths of the book include the contextualization of clinical interviewing into multimethod assessment; the focus on interviewing children, parents and teachers; recurring case examples to illustrate concepts; and specific attention to the interpretation of interview data. The contributed chapters on assessing suicide and youth violence risks are welcome and timely. In my opinion, there is no better resource for clinical interviewing."--Robert J.

As a result, many dedicated teachers choose to avoid controversial issues altogether in preference for "safe" knowledge and "safe" teaching practices. Diana Hess interrupts this dangerous trend by providing readers a spirited and detailed argument for why curricula and teaching based on controversial issues are truly crucial at this time. Through rich empirical research from real classrooms throughout the nation, she demonstrates why schools have the potential to be particularly powerful sites for democratic education and why this form of education must include sustained attention to authentic and controversial political issues that animate political communities. The purposeful inclusion of controversial issues in the school curriculum, when done wisely and well, can communicate by example the essence of what makes communities democratic while simultaneously building the skills and dispositions that young people will need to live in and improve such communities.</p></p><p><p><strong>Diana E .

Sometimes known by other names&#x2014;especially master plan or general plan&#x2014;the type of plan described here is the predominant form of general governmental planning in the U.S. Although many government agencies make plans for their own programs or facilities, the comprehensive plan is the only planning document that considers multiple programs and that accounts for activities on all land located within the planning area, including both public and private property.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written by a former president of the American Planning Association, <i>Community Planning</i> is thorough, specific, and timely. It addresses such important contemporary issues as sustainability, walkable communities, the role of urban design in public safety, changes in housing needs for a changing population, and multi-modal transportation planning. Unlike competing books, it addresses all of these topics in the context of the local comprehensive plan.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is a broad audience for this book: planning students, practicing planners, and individual citizens who want to better understand local planning and land use controls. Boxes at the end of each chapter explain how professional planners and individual citizens, respectively, typically engage the issues addressed in the chapter. For all readers, <i>Community Planning</i> provides a pragmatic view of the comprehensive plan, clearly explained by a respected authority.</p><p>Eric Kelly is a professor of urban planning at Ball State University. He is a past president of the American Planning Association and has more than thirty years of experience consulting with local governments in thirty-five states.<br>"Eric Damian Kelly's <i>Community Planning, Second Edition</i> is nothing less than a master work planning practice. Whether you are a student or seasoned pro, you absolutely cannot be withou it. Kelly goes well beyond the conventional land use perspective in describing the formulation of comprehensive plans and addressing all plan elements and how they fit together. Moreover, he teases out implementation issues in evey chapter, propelling the reader from analysis to action. Finally there is always an ethical backdrop in this book, distinguishing it from others in the field. Kelly reminds us that we are commanded to 'replenish the earth' as a basic concept in sustainability&#x2014;wise advice, like everything in this magnificent text." (Stuart Meck <i>Edward J.

Indeed, from childhood most of us develop some mental image of a witch--usually an old woman, mysterious and malignant. But why do witches still feature so heavily in our cultures and consciousness? From Halloween superstitions to literary references such as Faust and, of course, Harry Potter, witches seem ever-present in our lives. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Malcolm Gaskill takes a long historical perspective, from the ancient world to contemporary paganism. This is a book about the strangeness of the past, and about contrasts and change; but it's also about affinity and continuity. He reveals that witchcraft is multi-faceted, that it has always meant different things to different people, and that in every age it has raised questions about the distinction between fantasy and reality, faith and proof. Delving into court records, telling anecdotes, and challenging myths, Gaskill re-examines received wisdom, especially concerning the European witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He also explores the modern memory and reinvention of witchcraft--as history, religion, fiction, and metaphor.<br></p><p><p></p><p><strong><i>Witchcraft</i>: Questions for Consideration and Discussion</strong> </p><p></p> <li>How have the stereotypes, images, and cultural associations of witchcraft changed between the classical age and the present day? </li><p></p> <li>Why throughout history have witches been so strongly associated with women? </li><p></p> <li>What are the major historical myths about witches, especially during the witch craze, and why are they so hard to dispel with hard fact? </li><p></p> <li>How can we explain the massive surge of witchcraft trials in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries? </li><p></p> <li>What emotion is involved in witchcraft accusations, and is it helpful to think in terms of "hysteria"--for example in relation to the Salem trials of 1692? </li><p></p> <li>Why does the fascination with witches endure in popular culture, in everything from novels and films to cartoons and games?</li><p></p><br><strong>Malcolm Gaskill</strong> is Reader in Early Modern History at the University of East Anglia.<br></p><h2>Morning and Evening: New International Version</h2><p><p>Experience the peace that comes from digging into God's Word in the morning and at night with Spurgeon's <em>Morning and Evening</em> Daily Devotional! </p> <p><strong>Have you ever read a devotional and wished it went a little deeper into Scripture?</strong> This devotional doesn't just encourage you; it digs into key verses and pulls out incredible study insights that will grow your understanding of who God is.

But King Alfred ensured the survival of Wessex, his son Eadweard expanded it, and his grandson �thelstan finally united Mercia and Wessex, conquered Northumbria and became <i>Rex totius Britanniae</i>. Tom Holland recounts this extraordinarily exciting story with relish and drama. We meet the great figures of the age, including Alfred and his daughter �thelfl�d, 'Lady of the Mercians', who brought �thelstan up at the Mercian court.

That is, until she was unexpectedly diagnosed with an aggressive type of breast cancer at the age of 35. As she underwent more than a year of treatment, Pickert realized that the popular understanding of breast care in America bears little resemblance to the experiences of today's patients and the rapidly changing science designed to save their lives. After using her journalistic skills to navigate her own care, Pickert embarked on a quest to understand the cultural, scientific and historical forces shaping the lives of breast-cancer patients in the modern age.<br>Breast cancer is one of history's most prolific killers. Despite billions spent on research and treatments, it remains one of the deadliest diseases facing women today. From the forests of the Pacific Northwest to an operating suite in Los Angeles to the epicenter of pink-ribbon advocacy in Dallas, Pickert reports on the turning points and people responsible for the progress that has been made against breast cancer and documents the challenges of defeating a disease that strikes one in eight American women and has helped shape the country's medical culture.<br>Drawing on interviews with doctors, economists, researchers, advocates and patients, as well as on journal entries and recordings collected over the author's treatment, <i>Radical</i> puts the story of breast cancer into context, and shows how modern treatments represent a long overdue shift in the way doctors approach cancer -- and disease -- itself.</p><p>Kate Pickert is a former staff writer for <i>TIME</i> magazine, where she covered health care, politics and trends in modern American life. She is a journalism professor at Loyola Marymount University and lives in Los Angeles with her husband and daughter.<br>"On the surgeons, cancer researchers, and activists working on the front lines of this complicated and often politically fraught disease, Pickert writes bravely, with equal parts heart and heft, and pitch-perfect detail."&#x2015;<b><i>Beth Macy, author of <i>Dopesick</i></i></b><br><br>"Kate Pickert does a great job of using her own story to bring the people and history of breast cancer treatment and advocacy to a modern audience."&#x2015;<b><i>Susan M.

The works were originally shown at the prestigious Tomio Koyama Gallery in Tokyo in February 2009,</p><p>Blending themes of pop culture with techniques reminiscent of the old masters, Mark Ryden has created a singular style that blurs the traditional boundaries between high and low art. His work first garnered attention in the 1990s when he ushered in a new genre of painting, &#34;Pop Surrealism&#34;, dragging a host of followers in his wake. Ryden has trumped the initial surrealist strategies by choosing subject matter loaded with cultural connotation. Ryden&#39;s vocabulary ranges from cryptic to cute, treading a fine line between nostalgic clich� and disturbing archetype. Seduced by his infinitely detailed and meticulously glazed surfaces, the viewer is confronted with the juxtaposition of the childhood innocence and the mysterious recesses of the soul. A subtle disquiet inhabits his paintings; the work is achingly beautiful as it hints at darker psychic stuff beneath the surface of cultural kitsch. In Ryden&#39;s world cherubic girls rub elbows with strange and mysterious figures. Ornately carved frames lend the paintings a baroque exuberance that adds gravity to their enigmatic themes. Mark Ryden received a BFA in 1987 from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. His paintings have been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide, including a retrospective &#34;Wondertoonel&#34; at the Frye Museum of Art in Seattle and Pasadena Museum of California Art, and in the exhibition &#34;The Artist&#39;s Museum&#34; at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. He currently lives and works in Los Angeles.Last summer, I posted about Mark Ryden&#39;s wonderful and inexpensive Tree Show postcard set. The follow up, The Snow Yak Show Microportfolio is even more delightful in my opinion because the art is from his Tokyo show last year which included some of my favorite Ryden paintings ever. -- David Pescovitz, Boingboing.net --Boing Boing</p><h2>The Dark Corners of the Night (Unsub Series, Book 3) (Unsub, 3)</h2><p><p>I am the legion of the night </p><p>He appears in the darkness like a ghost, made of shadows and fear--the Midnight Man.

In 1976 the Point Reyes Wilderness Act granted the highest protection in America to more than 33,000 acres of California forest, grassland and shoreline - including Drakes Estero, an estuary of stunning beauty. Inside was a small, family-run oyster farm first established in the 1930s. A local rancher bought the business in 2005, renaming it The Drakes Bay Oyster Company. When the National Park Service informed him that the 40-year lease would not be renewed past 2012, he vowed to keep the farm in business even if it meant taking his fight all the way to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Environmentalists, national politicians, scientists, and the Department of the Interior all joined a protracted battle for the estuary that had the power to influence the future of wilderness for decades to come. Were the oyster farmers environmental criminals, or victims of government fraud? Fought against a backdrop of fear of government corruption and the looming specter of climate change, the battle struck a national nerve, pitting nature against agriculture and science against politics, as it sought to determine who belonged and who didn't belong, and what it means to be wild.</p><p><b>Summer Brennan</b> was born to parents living in a houseboat on the San Francisco Bay. She has written for magazines and newspapers all over the country and works regularly with the United Nations Press Office in New York covering issues related to decolonization, disarmament, human rights and the environment.

The great value of Brennan&#x2019;s book, even if it gets, as she writes, only as close to the truth as I could reasonably be expected to come,&#x201d; is her deeply probing effort to understand and craft as full and complex an account as possible." <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br><br>"in Brennan&#x2019;s hands, it&#x2019;s also a pleasure to vicariously relive the oyster war. Brennan&#x2019;s narrative skills are marked by a relaxed pace, diligent reporting and a scrupulous but fun dive into backstory with ample historical and scientific pigmentation....Brennan is a natural storyteller who makes a tough tale that many locals and visitors winced through and tiptoed around into a narrative celebration of the striking landscape of the Point Reyes Peninsula, and the spirit behind the oyster war itself." <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"In <i>The Oyster War</i>, Brennan writes with clarity and grace about an environmental conflict centered on an oyster farm in one of the most beautiful preserves in America, the Point Reyes National Seashore in Northern California, as the forces of history, culture, and politics converge to decide the farm&#x2019;s fate. Her saga raises the question: How far can one go to return a land to wilderness,&#x2019; when throughout its history it supported all manner of human endeavor? It&#x2019;s a compelling and evocative read for anyone who, like me, shares Brennan's belief that this territory is, in fact, &#x2019;a little bit magic.&#x2019;" Erik Larson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Devil in the White City</i> and <i>Dead Wake</i><br><br> Brennan is a lyrical and lovely writer.&#x201d; <i>Reason Magazine</i><br><br>"An absorbing account of the clash between environmentalists and oyster farmers in the coastal towns north of San Francisco. . .

More than a delicacy best enjoyed with Champagne, the prized bivalve is metaphor for the intersection of environment and commerce. The Oyster War is a must read for anyone who cares about the poetry and politics of the plate. It&#x2019;s a local story that asks questions with national implications: when commerce and the environment meet, what does it mean to protect something wild?" Anne Zimmerman, author of <i>An Extravagant Hunger: The Passionate Years of M.F.K. Fisher</i><br><br> Like the northern California fog she perfectly evokes, Brennan weaves her way around the tricky terrain of what wilderness means today. The Oyster War is a smart, page-turning account of what happens when a cultural landscape is imagined as something potentially pristine. Her superb research, local&#x2019;s vibe, balanced view, and ability to summon the magic that is Point Reyes, make The Oyster War vital reading for everyone interested in the future of U.S. environmentalism." Amanda Adams Hinde, author of <i>A Mermaid's Tale</i> and <i>Ladies of the Field</i><br><br>"In these times of crucial need to protect both wild places and working landscapes supporting real people, difficult decisions must be made about who gets to stay and who must go. But we quickly find ourselves in a hall of mirrors. This is a devoutly honest book whose author recognizes that sometimes the closest we can get to truth is a matter of opinion.

An account of the famous trial of Socrates in 399 b.c., it appeals to historians, philosophers, political scientists, classicists, and literary critics. It is also essential reading for students of ancient Greek.</p><p>This new commentary on Plato&#x2019;s canonical work is designed to accommodate the needs of students in intermediate-level Greek classes, where they typically encounter the <i>Apology</i> for the first time. Paul Allen Miller and Charles Platter, two highly respected classicists and veteran instructors, present the <i>Apology</i> in its traditional thirty-three-chapter structure. They amplify the text with running commentary and glosses of unfamiliar words at the bottom of each page; brief chapter introductions to relevant philosophical, historical, and rhetorical issues; and a separate series of thought-provoking essays, one on each chapter. The essays can serve as bases for class discussions or as starting points for paper topics or general reflection.</p><p>By integrating background material into the text at regular intervals rather than front-loading it in a lengthy initial overview or burying it in back-of-the-book endnotes, the authors offer students a rich encounter with the text. Their commentary incorporates the latest research on both the trial of Socrates and Plato&#x2019;s version of it, and it engages major philosophical issues from a contemporary perspective. This book is not only a much-needed aid for students of Greek. It is also the basis of a complete course on the <i>Apology.</i></p></p><p><p><strong>Paul Allen Miller</strong> is Carolina Distinguished Professor of Classics and Comparative Literature at the University of South Carolina.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p></p><h2>Immanuel in Our Place: Seeing Christ in Israel&#39;s Worship (The Gospel According to the Old Testament)</h2><p>This book provides fascinating insights into the Old Testament tabernacle and temple, the priesthood, the sacrifices, and festivals.

It owes, of course, nothing to Europe or the classical Orient. It is tremendous in variety, differing region by region, era by era, often tribe by tribe. It is always vigorously distinctive. This book, 20 years in preparation, shows us that art in all its profuse diversity and in the almost numberless crafts for which the American Indian is famous. <br>Well over 700 examples, drawn with painstaking care, are shown: representations of flora and fauna, men and gods, earth and sky; symbols of clan and tribe, religion and magic; formal designs from the primal to the highly intricate. They appear in examples of basketry, weaving, pottery, sculpture, painting, lapidary work, masks, drumheads, weapons, apparel, beadwork, goldwork, blankets, ponchos, and many other forms. The arts and crafts of Inca, Tiahuanaco, Chim�, Maya, Axtec, Zapotec, Totonac, Mixtec, Navaho, Zuni, Hopi, Apache, Cherokee, Creek, Winnebago, Dakota, Blackfoot, Nez Perc�, Cheyenne, Crow, Sioux, Cochiti, Haida, Bellacoola, and others known and unknown are here. <br>Each section is preceded by a page of typical motifs of an area, making it easy to isolate the design elements. In addition, the lore and tradition behind the designs are told in a text reproducing the Indians' own stories and songs. Separate indices simplify locating the work of particular tribes and regions. <br>Craftspeople will find in this book a prolific source of timeless, eternally valid design ideas representing years of research in museums all over the hemisphere; for the graphic artist there is a wealth of material than can be adapted directly to his needs.

Such composers as Webern, Bart�k, Var�se, Messianen, and even John Cage owe a debt to Debussy's innovations in harmony, coloring, and psychological penetration.<br>Similarly, Ravel's achievements in pianistic style, sophisticated harmonies, and bold experiments with form had a profound effect on both contemporary and later musicians. Each composer wrote only one string quartet, but by virtue of their individuality, unique interpretations of the medium and delicate and subtle beauties, both compositions enjoy a special place in the chamber music repertoire.<br>This attractive, high-quality volume, based on authoritative French editions, brings both influential masterpieces together in one inexpensive resource.

To help herself adjust to life away from Los Angeles and her extended family, she writes letters to her great-uncle Jim and her beloved Abuelita, both recently deceased, and embarks on a correspondence course in poultry care with the mysterious Agnes of Redwood Farm Supply. Agnes's poorly typed responses assure Sophie that the chickens that keep turning up on the farm (including Henrietta, a small white hen with a permanent unibrow of fury) belonged to her great-uncle, from whom Sophie's father inherited the farm and who implores her to keep the chickens safe&#x2014;and to be careful. But how will she protect chickens that are capable of levitating their own coop, becoming invisible, and turning enemies to stone? And why does the town's resident chicken expert, Ms. Griegson, seem intent on stealing Sophie's brood? Told in letters, quizzes, newspaper clippings, and delicious ink drawings reminiscent of Quentin Blake, this middle grade epistolary novel has a little magic and a lot of warm family humor. Jones delivers a dynamic Latina protagonist in Sophie, who describes her experiences in satisfying detail: the discomfort of facing microaggressions based on her heritage (such as when the town librarian assumes that she and her family are migrant workers); love and concern for her parents, both struggling to find and keep work; and willingness to learn and grow despite typical tween self-consciousness. VERDICT Readers will cheer for Sophie and clamor for more of those amazing chickens.

Valuable artifacts are mysteriously misplaced by a prominent archaeological institution. Three celebrated astronauts perish in a suspicious fire after voicing their criticism of the US space program. Yet our world&#x2019;s most powerful agencies hastily dispel these alarming reports as conspiracy theories, and bury them in padlocked archives. The fact is that a suppression syndrome exists in our society. <i>Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries </i>exposes the startling degree of truth behind the rumors. <br><br> Jonathan Eisen has collected over forty intriguing stories of scientific cover-ups and programs of misinformation concocted to conceal some of the most phenomenal innovations in mankind&#x2019;s history. These no-holds-barred accounts force us to confront the naivet�&#x2014;and danger&#x2014;of trusting our academic and political leaders to act always for the common good. <i>Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries </i>presents documented evidence that corporate self-interest, scientific arrogance, and political savvy have contrived to keep us in the dark about technological breakthroughs or interplanetary contact that may shift the current balance of power. <br><br> Prepare yourself for a revealing look at the research and development to which we&#x2019;ve been denied access. <i>Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries </i>begins by examining the ties that bind the medical establishment to powerful pharmaceutical corporations. Then it details the struggle of the independent research against Orthodox Science and its code of conduct, the Scientific Method. Next, the book investigates the cover-up of information concerning UFOs and extraterrestrial life that&#x2019;s certain to make you reconsider what you thought was science fiction. The final section discusses just a few of the numerous alternate energy resources and fuel savers that, if put on the market today, would soon run the fossil fuel monopolies out of business.</p><p><b>Jonathan Eisen</b> completed his undergraduate education at Oberlin College and earned his MA from the University of Illinois.

The lack of coherent strategic direction from Paris in the chaotic years of the Fourth Republic left the military with the task of making political decisions in the field. With the original introduction by Bernard B. Fall and a new foreword prepared by Eliot A. Cohen.</p></p><p><p>This book examines how the French military spent decades fighting rear-guard actions in Indochina against ideologically motivated insurgents in the 1940s and 1950s.</p><p><b>Roger Trinquier</b> (1908-1986) was born into a peasant family and was graduated from the military academy at Saint-Maixent. He was posted in the Far East for much of his career. Following World War II, he campaigned in Vietnam before returning to organize and train a colonial parachute battalion in France. Then he was reassigned to Indochina as an expert on counterguerrilla warfare. This tour was followed by his active role in the revolt of May 1958 by the French army in Algeria, for which he was labeled a political colonel. Afterward Colonel Trinquier led a group of fellow officers-recruited from elite units and officially retired, but with the approval of the Ministry of Defense- to serve as mercenaries in Katanga Province, Zaire, under the secessionist leader Moise Tshombe. He published La Guerre Moderne, which was translated into English, and a number of other books dealing with the Indochina war and the exploits of French airborne forces.</p></p><h2>1000 Best Short Games of Chess</h2><p>Descriptions of the winning moves are elaborated by commentary and anecdotes</p><p></p><h2>The Antikythera Mechanism: The History and Mystery of the Ancient World&#x2019;s Most Famous Astronomical Device</h2><p>*Includes pictures *Chronicles the discovery and theories over the mechanism's origins and capabilities *Includes footnotes, online resources and a bibliography for further reading. *Includes a table of contents "It multiplies, divides and subtracts, but you can't program it." - Michael Edmunds Discovering ancient shipwrecks hasn&#x2019;t been a novelty for thousands of years, but when artifacts were salvaged from a Roman shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1900, the discovery of one set off one of the great mysteries of antiquity. When sponge divers investigated the shipwreck, they found the kind of items often associated with such discoveries, including marble statues, pottery, jewelry, and coins, but they also discovered a strange object, the likes of which nobody had ever seen before. Initially assumed to be pieces of rock, it turned out that the item, soon to be dubbed the Antikythera mechanism, consisted of dozens of pieces, many of which had gears. In fact, while scholars quickly deduced that it had an astronomical purpose, many believed the mechanism was too advanced to actually date back to antiquity. As it turned out, of course, the Antikythera mechanism did date back to the 1st or 2nd century BCE, and as scholars began to more fully comprehend its abilities, fascination over the device grew. In conjunction with the determination that the mechanism was an analog computer of sorts that could predict astronomical phenomena like the positions of stars and eclipses, conjecture over the origins of the device led to theories over what the Romans were going to do with it, and whether the device was created by the Greek genius Archimedes himself. To this day, debate continues over whether there were predecessors to the model, where the astronomical observations that went into creating the model were taken, and whether the ultimate origins of the device might even be Babylonian. The Antikythera Mechanism: The History and Mystery of the Ancient World&#x2019;s Most Famous Astronomical Device chronicles the discovery and study of the famous device. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Antikythera mechanism like never before, in no time at all.</p><p></p><h2>Netherland (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p><p><b>New York Times Book Review Best Book of the Year&nbsp;</b><br><br>In a New York City made phantasmagorical by the events of 9/11, and left alone after his English wife and son return to London, Hans van den Broek stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country.

With a dry wit and a clean line, Delisle makes the most of his time spent in Asia overseeing outsourced production for a French animation company. He brings to life the quick pace of Shenzhen's crowded streets. By translating his fish-out-of-water experiences into accessible graphic novels, Delisle skillfully notes the differences between Western and Eastern cultures, while also conveying his compassion for the simple freedoms that escape his colleagues in the Communist state.</p></p><p><p><b>Guy Delisle</b> is a cartoonist and animator. His most recent book is <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>Last year's <i>Pyongyang</i> introduced Delisle's acute voice, as he reported from North Korea with unusual insight and wit, not to mention wonderfully detailed cartooning. <i>Shenzhen</i> is not a follow-up so much as another installment in what one hopes is an ongoing series of travelogues by this talented artist. Here he again finds himself working on an animated movie in a Communist country, this time in Shenzhen, an isolated city in southern China. Delisle not only takes readers through his daily routine, but also explores Chinese custom and geography, eloquently explaining the cultural differences city to city, company to company and person to person. He also goes into detail about the food and entertainment of the region as well as animation in general and his own career path. All of this is the result of his intense isolation for three months in an anonymous hotel room. He has little to do but ruminate on his surroundings, and readers are the lucky beneficiaries of his loneliness. As in his earlier work, Delisle draws in a gentle cartoon style: his observations are grounded in realism, but his figures are light cartoons, giving the book, as Delisle himself remarks, a feeling of an alternative Tintin. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She and her family have been protected from the worst of the terror and desperation overtaking her country by a high-ranking Nazi who wishes to marry her. So when an escaped Jewish boy arrives on Elsie&#x2019;s doorstep on Christmas Eve, Elsie understands that opening the door would put all she loves in danger.<br><br>Sixty years later, in El Paso, Texas, Reba Adams is trying to file a feel-good Christmas piece for the local magazine, and she sits down with the owner of Elsie's German Bakery for what she expects will be an&nbsp;easy interview.&nbsp;But Reba finds herself returning to the bakery again and again,&nbsp;anxious to find the heart of the story&#x2014;a story that resonates with her own turbulent past. For Elsie, Reba&#x2019;s questions are a stinging reminder of that last bleak year of World War II. <br><br>As the two women's lives become intertwined, both are forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past and seek out the courage to forgive.</p><p><strong>Chris Bohjalian on <i>The Baker's Daughter</i></strong> <p>Chris Bohjalian&#x2019;s most recent novel, <em>The Night Strangers</em>, was published in October. His novel <em>Skeletons at the Feast</em> is a love story set in Poland and Germany in the last six months of World War II.</p> <p></p> <p>Hitler's thousand year Reich lasted but twelve years and change, and has now been gone over six and a half decades. The survivors of the concentration camps are well into their seventies--and beyond--and even a teenage boy handed a Panzerfaust and pressed into service in the Volkssturm in 1945 is likely to be on the far side of 80.</p> <p>But Nazi Germany will never fade into the collective mist we reserve for much of history: Its crimes were of a magnitude both too massive and too barbaric ever to be forgotten. At the same time, the generation that destroyed it was undeniably among the greatest.</p> <p>Consequently, there will always be stories. There is a reason we are drawn to such poignant and powerful novels as Tatiana de Rosnay&#x2019;s <em>Sarah&#x2019;s Key</em> and Jenna Blum&#x2019;s <em>Those Who Save Us</em>.</p> <p>Sarah McCoy's second novel, <i>The Baker's Daughter</i>, certainly belongs beside them. It begins with one of those footnotes to Nazi Germany that is as appalling as it is bizarre: The Lebensborn program. Wanting to expand the master race, the Nazis mated Aryan soldiers with young Aryan girls. (The program also kidnapped Aryan-appearing children from the occupied countries and brought them to Greater Germany to be raised by faithful Nazis, but that element does not figure in the novel.)</p> <p>Hazel Schimdt, when the novel opens at the end of 1944, has already given birth to a son and a set of twins in the program, and is living in a combination Lebensborn brothel and nursery in Steinhorning, Germany. Her seventeen-year-old sister, Elsie--the young woman who gives the novel its title--is home with their parents, helping to run the bakery in Garmisch. Germany is on the verge of collapse, but defeatism will still get a person shot by SS diehards and the crematoria at the death camps are still turning to ash the victims of the Nazi&#x2019;s Final Solution.</p> <p>And yet Elsie has a marriage proposal--and an engagement ring--from an older SS officer. She isn&#x2019;t sure she loves him, but she is hiding a small Jewish boy in her bedroom and fears that she and her family will need that officer&#x2019;s protection if the child is somehow discovered.</p> <p>Elsie&#x2019;s story in 1944 and 1945 reverberates six decades later, in El Paso, Texas. A young journalist there, Reba Adams, is engaged to an agent with the U.S. Border Patrol, and--a bit like Elsie years earlier--she is not quite sure she can marry the fellow. While writing what she views as a Christmas fluff piece on holiday traditions for a local magazine, Reba goes to a German bakery in the area and meets...Elsie.</p> <p>Consequently, the novel travels back and forth in time, moving between Elsie&#x2019;s story and Reba&#x2019;s, often using the correspondence between Elsie and Hazel (and between Reba and her own sister back east). Many of McCoy&#x2019;s characters shoulder deep and profoundly painful secrets, including Reba&#x2019;s father and Elsie&#x2019;s mother.</p> <p>McCoy is too intelligent a novelist to compare the U.S. Border Patrol with Hitler&#x2019;s SS, but Reba&#x2019;s fianc� nevertheless find the process of rounding up, detaining, and deporting illegal aliens an increasingly draconian and soul-killing operation. Moreover, McCoy understands that Reba&#x2019;s small dramas in 2007 pale before the dangers that confront Elsie in 1944 and 1945. But she deftly explores how easy it is to allow first one&#x2019;s integrity and then one&#x2019;s humanity to slip away. </p> <p>Likewise, the parallels that McCoy draws between the present and the past--and how it difficult it can be to do the right thing--make for a thoughtful reading experience indeed.</p> <p><strong><i>The Baker's Daughter</i> Q&amp;A: Lisa See and Sarah McCoy</strong></p> <p><b>Lisa See is the author of the bestsellers <em>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</em>, <em>Shanghai Girls</em>, and <em>Dreams of Joy</em>.</b></p> <p></p> <p><b>Lisa See:</b> The novel moves back and forth between two vastly different settings: present-day America on the Tex-Mex border and Nazi Germany at the end of World War II. What inspired you to pair the two?</p> <p><b>Sarah McCoy:</b> I found their association captivating: both moments in time allowed me to explore racial themes, the courage needed to do right, and the complexity in deciding just what that may be. I spent a portion of my childhood in Germany where my dad, a career military officer, was stationed. My husband also grew up in Germany, speaks fluent German, and worked there during his summers in college. When we moved to El Paso, the local magazine asked me to write a feature article on the German community. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a German community?&#x201d; I asked. Yes--a thriving one. Way out on the corner of Texas, barely clinging to the edge of the United States, is a sizable German air force base. Apparently the Luftwaffe has trained fliers in the United States since 1958. In 1992, they consolidated their troops at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, just up the road from El Paso.</p> <p>Not long after that article ran, I went to a local farmer&#x2019;s market and met an 80-year-old German woman selling bread. I was completely smitten by her, and all that I imagined she might have experienced in her life. While picking out my br�tchen, I asked how she came to be in El Paso. &#x201c;I married an American soldier after the war,&#x201d; she told me. Voila! Elsie, my 1945 protagonist, was born. My memories of living and traveling in Germany served as my imaginative landscape and fueled my hunger to research the country and its people during those last awful months of World War. </p> <p>Teaching at the University of Texas at El Paso, many of my students wrote about their fear and anxiety regarding the deportation of family and friends. I imagined many in Germany (Aryan, Jewish, etc.) felt similarly.</p> <p><b>Lisa:</b> There&#x2019;s a great deal of research that went into both storylines. Did anything surprise you?</p> <p><b>Sarah:</b> I was shocked and surprised at nearly every document about Germany and El Paso. I&#x2019;d yell to my husband, "Oh my God! Did you know...." And despite living and working in Germany for years, despite living and working in El Paso now, he never once answered yes. Of course the research into Nazi Germany unearthed deeply disturbing facts. The Lebensborn Program, for one, took me months to emotionally process. I searched for every opportunity to disprove its existence. I didn&#x2019;t want to believe. Then I realized that disbelief, unwillingness to confront the truth and take a stand, was a similar reaction to many German citizens. It was so unfathomable that it pained the soul. Not possible, I said. How could any human being do such things? Instead of pushing it away, I tried to harness that response and use it to shed light on dark secrets.</p> <p>The same was true of our present-day border issues. Living within a mile of Juarez, Mexico, I&#x2019;ve witnessed firsthand the dire struggle of illegal families. I see it on the news, at the grocery store, in my neighborhood. I felt it incumbent on me to speak--to tell the story and share what I&#x2019;ve seen.</p> <p><b>Lisa:</b> So we have two women protagonists: Reba in present day and Elsie in the past. Which perspective did you find was the easiest to write? Which was the most difficult?</p> <p><b>Sarah:</b> The leading female characters came pretty organically to my imagination. The Josef chapters were the most psychologically taxing. I had to take all the historical information I&#x2019;d gathered about the Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) and the horrors of the Nazi regime and flip my psyche--try to imagine it from the perspective of someone within. I had to remind myself that these weren&#x2019;t barbarous demons; these were men. They knew right from wrong, just as we all do. They weren&#x2019;t beyond human compassion. So then, I asked myself, how could they? Or, in this specific case, how could Josef rationalize and live with his actions. As the author, I had a responsibility to present his perspective without my own emotional judgments. That was difficult, but I believe those dark chapters are essential to the book. It&#x2019;s important to remember the innocent as well as the evil--so that we can immediately recognize the latter if we see it again.</p> <p><b>Lisa:</b> Familial relationships play a significant role in the novel, specifically daughterhood. There are many similarities and some stark differences between how Reba and Elsie appear as daughters in the novel. Do you think that&#x2019;s a product of culture or time or more?</p> <p><b>Sarah:</b> All of the above. The dynamic between mothers and daughters--women of varying generations--seems to be a reoccurring theme in my writing. Each new generation believes it is more advanced than its predecessor. However, history has proven to be a gigantic record spinning round on different threads but in the same motion. Our lives overlap whether we chose to acknowledge it or not. Both Reba and Elsie struggle to find themselves, to establish their own beliefs and make choices in alternate environments. Their places on earth may differ, but their journey is the same. The deep love and deep conflicts of daughterhood are undeniable. We accept, forgive, and learn from our mothers or we reject, condemn, and disregard. That choice is mirrored on the large-scale, too--in how we act as a people, as nations.</p> <p><b>Lisa:</b> I think this novel would work wonderfully for book clubs. What issues do you imagine readers discussing after they turn the last page?</p> <p><b>Sarah:</b> Oh, there are so many--love, forgiveness, exclusion, passivity, family dynamics, independence, courage and cowardice, and the list goes on. But mostly, after turning the last page, I hope all the issues in the novel penetrate and resonate in readers&#x2019; hearts and minds, thereby paying tribute to the memory of those who lived through those war-torn years and honoring the men, women, and families going through them now. I hope this book is a powerful illustration of just how influential one convicted person can be in changing the world--for good and for evil. All of history can be altered. If each of us took up the cause of good, imagine what we could do individually and together.</p> <p><b>Lisa:</b> And lastly, because I know readers will be wondering based on your title, do you have any recipes you regularly bake at home? You&#x2019;ve taken us into <i>The Baker&#x2019;s Daughter&#x2019;s</i> kitchen, would you mind giving us a glimpse into your own?</p> <p><b>Sarah:</b> I&#x2019;d love to! I greatly enjoy baking and cooking. I try to do it as often as possible. There&#x2019;s something therapeutic in the culinary process. To me, recipes are like prescriptions. When I&#x2019;m feeling stressed or anxious or simply need a mental reprieve, I head to the kitchen. I like to cook alone. I know this is different from many, but it&#x2019;s a Zen space for me. I don&#x2019;t have to talk or think too much. I can dream while I measure, crack, whisk, and pour. So long as I follow the instructions, I have guaranteed success. Baking satisfies all of my tactile senses: colors, textures, tastes, sounds, and smells. In under two hours, I&#x2019;ve created something start to finish. It&#x2019;s an instant gratification achievement.</p> <p>That was a long-winded answer to the question: what do you bake? On a weekly basis, I bake a lot of savory dishes. My go-to's are Mediterranean chicken and roasted veggies with parmesan cheese. But I love the holiday season when I get to try my hand at elaborate, sweet ones--Black Forest Cake, macarons, gingerbread and springerles. Truthfully, however, I&#x2019;m pretty easy to please. The smell of almonds, sea salted and cinnamon sprinkled, roasting in the oven is just about the ultimate for me. When it comes to family traditions, my mom bakes a lean, mean peanut butter chocolate kiss cookie that my husband calls &#x201c;the best cookie in the history of mankind.&#x201d; As her daughter, I'm privy to the secret recipe.</p><b>SARAH MCCOY</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling&nbsp;author of the novel&nbsp;<i>The Time It Snowed in Puerto Rico. </i>She has taught at Old Dominion University and at the University of Texas at El Paso.

I shrug, staring at a folded dishtowel next to the sink. It&#x2019;s red and white with a picture of a rooster on it. &#x201c;It was a really big zit,&#x201d; I say. I cleaned the blood from my face and covered the piercing with a Band-Aid before my mom saw it, but I&#x2019;ve had to change the Band-Aid twice since she&#x2019;s been home. Already the new one is red with blood.</p><p>Mom puts the chicken in the fridge, frowning as she closes the door. Our phone rings, and Mom leans over the counter and picks it up. &#x201c;Flores residence,&#x201d; she answers. A tinny-sounding voice echoes from the other end of the receiver, and Mom smiles. &#x201c;One moment. It&#x2019;s your friend Riley,&#x201d; she says, handing me the phone. &#x201c;She says she has a homework question. Just don&#x2019;t take too long.&#x201d;</p><p>I slip out the back door with the phone and curl up in the wooden chair on our patio. Our backyard stretches forever, without any streetlights or nearby houses to break it up. It&#x2019;s unnerving, like being walled in on all sides with empty space. Insects buzz restlessly, like white noise. I tuck my legs beneath me.</p><p>&#x201c;Riley?&#x201d; I say into the phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Sof? I saw you with Brooklyn!&#x201d; My stomach twists, but Riley continues talking before I can worry about whether she changed her mind about the spying. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me? What did you find out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, really. She took me with her to get a tattoo.&#x201d; I run a finger along the edge of the bandage on my forehead but decide to keep the details of my piercing to myself.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; Riley sounds disappointed. I lower my hand, quiet for a second as I try to work out what I want to say.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you expect me to find?&#x201d; My voice comes out sharper than I intend, but I don&#x2019;t apologize for it. Riley said she was trying to help Brooklyn, but it sounds like she just wanted her to screw up.</p><p>&#x201c;She skinned a cat and left it outside our school.&#x201d; Riley&#x2019;s voice has an edge to it. &#x201c;Or did you forget?&#x201d;</p><p>I press my lips together to keep myself from arguing. Riley thinks Brooklyn skinned that cat. Tattoos and cigarettes aren&#x2019;t in the same league as animal mutilation.</p><p>Riley clears her throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay, Sof? She didn&#x2019;t hurt you, did she? Or manipulate you in some way?&#x201d; The concern in Riley&#x2019;s voice is real, and suddenly I feel terrible. Riley&#x2019;s been a real friend to me since I got here, not Brooklyn. I exhale and shake my head, pulling at a piece of loose skin near my fingernail.</p><p>&#x201c;No, it was nothing like that. She was . . .&#x201d; Cool. The word pops into my head uninvited. &#x201c;She was weird,&#x201d; I finish instead.</p><p>As the word leaves my mouth I realize it&#x2019;s just as true. Brooklyn was cool, but I get what Riley means&#x2014; something about her did feel off. I think of her slender fingers on Santos&#x2019;s needles, her wolfish grin, and how she persuaded me so effortlessly to get a piercing. She made it too easy to be bad.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll find something better tomorrow,&#x201d; I mumble. There&#x2019;s a beat of silence. I clear my throat. &#x201c;How are things between you and Josh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, didn&#x2019;t you hear? We&#x2019;re all better now,&#x201d; Riley says. &#x201c;He sent flowers to my class third period. Roses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow. That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Riley says before I can continue. &#x201c;I just want to say I&#x2019;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable when I asked you to hang out with Brooklyn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Riley, you didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I insist. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I think she really needs help. I have this feeling like she&#x2019;s standing on the edge of a cliff and she&#x2019;s about to go over. Like she&#x2019;ll fall if we don&#x2019;t help her.&#x201d;</p><p>I run my thumb over a cuticle in slow circles. I try to picture Brooklyn at the edge of a cliff, her combat boots sending rocks off the edge, but it just doesn&#x2019;t fit with the girl I hung out with this afternoon. Brooklyn was having fun, not crying out for help. &#x201c;You really think it&#x2019;s that bad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I really do. Did she tell you she&#x2019;s having a party tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t mention it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I heard some kids talking about it at school. It&#x2019;s supposed to be intense. You should go.&#x201d;</p><p>I run my tongue over my lips, which are dry now from the cold creeping over the yard. The last party I went to was in a house in the woods, next to the train tracks that ran through town. A bunch of football players stood just inside the door, loudly rating every girl who walked past, and every time a train rolled through, the whole house shook and everyone took a shot.</p><p>When I don&#x2019;t answer right away, Riley starts to plead. &#x201c;Come on, Sofia! There&#x2019;s a reason I picked you for this. Some people have evil inside them, but that&#x2019;s what God is for, to fix them when they can&#x2019;t fix themselves. We can still fix Brooklyn.&#x201d;</p><p>The insects in the yard have gone still, but wind sweeps over the grass and pounds against the windows. I shiver and pull my arms around my chest. Grandmother used to pray for people in her neighborhood when she thought they needed strength. This isn&#x2019;t any different, I guess. Riley&#x2019;s just a little more active with her faith. Grams would probably like her.</p><p>&#x201c;Sof? Are you still there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it. Promise.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p>I shiver as I make my way to Brooklyn&#x2019;s for the party the next night. An owl hoots in a nearby tree. I pull my sweatshirt tighter around my shoulders and lower my face. Wind sweeps through the tree branches, rattling them like bones. A man with a sagging gut and pock-marked face winks at me.</p><p>&#x201c;How you doing, cutie?&#x201d; he mumbles. His breath smells like whiskey and beef jerky. I hurry past him as he stumbles toward a dimly lit bar.</p><p>Brooklyn lives on the first floor of a cheap apartment complex. It&#x2019;s set up to look like a motel. All the apartment doors face an open-air hallway protected only by the cheap, painted aluminum guardrail. Just beyond the edge of the property, I can see the service road that leads to the tattoo parlor.</p><p>A sound like a gunshot echoes down the dark alley near her street. I freeze, every muscle in my body tensing to run. Then a car engine sputters on, and an old Buick pulls away from the curb. Not a gunshot&#x2014;a car backfiring. I exhale and keep moving. The sooner I make it to Brooklyn&#x2019;s place, the better.</p><p>Even if she hadn&#x2019;t slipped me the address in English lit class, I wouldn&#x2019;t have trouble finding Brooklyn&#x2019;s party. The music&#x2019;s so loud it vibrates through the parking lot, and the apartment door hangs open. Girls in short skirts and pierced, tattooed guys lounge against the wall, drinking from red Solo cups and smoking cigarettes that smell like pine needles. Green paint bubbles up around where they stubbed the butts out on the walls. Either they&#x2019;re all over twenty-one, or this isn&#x2019;t the kind of neighborhood that calls the cops for underage drinking.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, little girl!&#x201d; someone calls, startling me. I turn just as a large bald guy approaches. He towers above me, and he has to weigh at least two hundred pounds. He wears all black, and a white-and-black skull tattoo covers his face and bald head. It looks like he doesn&#x2019;t have any skin.</p><p>I start to turn back around, hoping he&#x2019;s not talking to me. He grabs my arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be like that. I&#x2019;m talking to you,&#x201d; he says. Deep black lines shadow his eyes, and tattoos of teeth stretch down over his lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a question.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shoot,&#x201d; I say, struggling to keep my voice steady. The man&#x2019;s lips part, but I can&#x2019;t tell if he&#x2019;s smiling at me or grimacing.</p><p>&#x201c;My friends and I are taking a poll.&#x201d; He nods to a group of people standing by the apartment door. They&#x2019;re all pierced and tattooed, but next to Skull Guy they look like members of a church group. &#x201c;If you could choose how you were going to die, would you rather be beaten to death with a shovel or have your face eaten off?&#x201d;</p><p>I swallow, trying to keep my nerves from showing on my face. The guy might be freaky looking, but he just wants to get a reaction out of me. It&#x2019;s all just part of his game.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d go for the face,&#x201d; I say, meeting his gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d want to look my killer in the eye.&#x201d;</p><p>This time I&#x2019;m sure Skull Guy smiles at me. The white-and-black cheekbone tattoos stretch across his face when his lips part. &#x201c;Solid,&#x201d; he says, bumping my fist.</p><p>I nod at a couple more people as I walk past, trying to look like I belong. The music pounds around me, an insistent bomp bomp bomp. Once inside, I push my sweatshirt hood back and glance around the room. It&#x2019;s smoky and dark. Bodies crowd around me, packed so tightly I can&#x2019;t move without bumping someone&#x2019;s arm or back. The floor is sticky, littered with empty beer cans.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t believe I worried this would be anything like my last party. It&#x2019;s a completely different world. I&#x2019;ve never heard the music before, and I don&#x2019;t think any of the people here actually go to our school. A girl with long, white-blond hair and glassy eyes passes a tiny bag of powder to another girl in a leather jacket, then walks away without glancing at her. I weave through the crowd to a table covered in booze and beer. I grab the single can of off-brand soda sitting next to a case of PBR, just so I have something to do with my hands.</p><p>A voice rises above the music, startling me. &#x201c;Sofia!&#x201d;</p><p>I turn and, through the sea of people pushing in on me, spot Charlie waving his hands above his head like he&#x2019;s signaling planes. If I were a cartoon character, my mouth would drop to the floor and exclamation points would shoot out of my eyes&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how excited I am to see him standing there, wearing a worn T-shirt with some faded sports logo on it and a dark gray zip-up sweatshirt. He moves around a crowd of guys to stand in front of me and says something I can&#x2019;t hear over the noise. I smile so wide the corners of my mouth threaten to split.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I shout.</p><p>He grins back at me, and even in the dark I notice the dimple in his cheek. Pushing the hair from my neck, he leans in close enough that his breath warms my skin.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s loud,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Wanna go outside?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie takes my hand, and we head for the back of the apartment to a smudged sliding glass door. I crack open my soda as Charlie pushes through the door and we slip outside. Cold air rushes to greet me, and I shiver, almost glad the can is warm, even if the soda tastes terrible.</p><p>&#x201c;You seem to be the only other person here not trying to get completely hammered,&#x201d; Charlie says once we&#x2019;ve left the pounding music behind.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a big drinker,&#x201d; I say. Charlie nods.</p><p>&#x201c;Me neither.&#x201d; He smiles at me again, that dimple appearing in his cheek. My stomach flips.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here. I don&#x2019;t really know anyone else.&#x201d; Charlie glances around at the kids sprawled on lawn chairs and hovering near the apartment door. At first I don&#x2019;t recognize any of them, either, but then I spot Tom wearing a backward baseball cap. He leans forward, passing his cigarette to a cute girl with black dreadlocks and thick glasses. The girl giggles at something he says, then leans in to kiss him. I cringe. Grace would be devastated.</p><p>Charlie sees him, too. &#x201c;I know Tom, I guess. But he&#x2019;s been preoccupied. Josh said he was coming, but I haven&#x2019;t seen him. And now I know you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Josh is coming to this party?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t think this was Josh&#x2019;s scene&#x2014;he seems so preppy, like Riley. Charlie shrugs.</p><p>I glance around at the patchy grass and dirty white lawn chairs. Beyond them, I see the outlines of a slide, a swing set, and what I assume is a pool surrounded by high wooden fencing. Despite the cold weather, I hear giggling and splashing.</p><p>A smile creeps across my face. I pull on Charlie&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;Come on. I have a plan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going swimming?&#x201d; Charlie asks when I start to lead him toward the pool.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s, like, fifty degrees out!&#x201d; I pull my sweatshirt tighter around my shoulders. &#x201c;Besides, I don&#x2019;t have a suit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201d;Why should that stop you?&#x201d;</p><p>I groan and push him toward the slide instead. The playground equipment is made of that old steel that isn&#x2019;t used at schools anymore, because people are afraid kids will impale themselves on the sharp metal while playing. I approach the slide hesitantly and test the bottom ladder rung to make sure it&#x2019;ll hold my weight.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; Charlie says. I raise an eyebrow in challenge.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s either the slide with me, or you go back to the party to hang out with people who don&#x2019;t even remember their names. Your choice.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie purses his lips, pretending to think this over. &#x201c;Which people, exactly?&#x201d;</p><p>I pick up a rock and threaten to throw it at him, and he raises his hands in surrender, laughing. &#x201c;Kidding, kidding.&#x201d; He jogs to the bottom of the slide and crouches down. &#x201c;Okay, go. I&#x2019;ll catch you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you to catch me,&#x201d; I say. I set my soda down on the ground and climb up the ladder, perching on top of the slide. Charlie grins.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you do.&#x201d; He grabs the sides of the slide with both hands and shakes, causing the entire thing to rattle. &#x201c;This thing is a death trap.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite the coolness of the night, the metal is warm beneath my hands. I push myself down, and as I start to gather speed, I shriek. Charlie grabs my shoulders before I hit the dirt and holds me steady.</p><p>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; he asks. He actually looks concerned. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe they let kids on that thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your turn,&#x201d; I say, pushing myself back to my feet. </p><p>Charlie grins and races around to the ladder. The entire slide rocks as he climbs, the metal creaking so badly I&#x2019;m convinced it&#x2019;s about to fall apart.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; Charlie says as he settles at the top. &#x201c;Now I have so much more respect for you for going first.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m a rebel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here goes nothing.&#x201d; Charlie pushes off and shoots down the slide. Somewhere along the way he goes into warp speed, and then he&#x2019;s not sliding anymore&#x2014; he&#x2019;s flying&#x2014;and I can&#x2019;t move out of the way before he tumbles into me. We both roll backward, hitting the dirt in a tangle of limbs.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; he says, pushing himself onto an elbow. He doesn&#x2019;t roll off me right away. &#x201c;Did I break you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I keep my arms still because I don&#x2019;t trust myself not to grab his sweatshirt and pull him even closer. I clear my throat. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re . . . fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Charlie tilts his head, and I wonder if he can tell what I&#x2019;m thinking. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really glad you&#x2019;re here, Sofia,&#x201d; he says. </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I did break your fall,&#x201d; I say. He still doesn&#x2019;t move away from me. He brushes a curl off my forehead and shakes his head like I&#x2019;m missing something. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just that. I&#x2019;m glad to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>The night instantly grows ten degrees warmer. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, right?&#x201d; Charlie eyes lose focus. He&#x2019;s about to kiss me. I inhale, hoping the warm soda hasn&#x2019;t made my mouth taste gross. But he just runs his thumb along my jaw, tracing from my ear to my chin, like he&#x2019;s memorizing my face.</p><p>&#x201c;I like you, okay? You&#x2019;re different from girls around here.&#x201d; He leans toward me again, his eyes closing. This time he hesitates an inch away from me.</p><p>&#x201c;Is this okay?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve barely spoken when he presses his mouth to mine&#x2014;tentati...</p></p><h2>The Mechanical Mind of John Coggin</h2><p><p>Roald Dahl meets <em>The Penderwicks</em> in this quirky, humorous, whimsical, and heartwarming middle grade debut about two siblings who run away from home to escape working in the family coffin business.</p><p>John Coggin is no ordinary boy.

She has nothing to sell except her only treasure&#x2014;her long, beautiful brown hair. Set in New York at the turn of the twentieth century, this classic piece of American literature tells the story of a young couple and the sacrifices each must make to buy the other a gift. Beautiful, delicate watercolors by award-winning illustrator Lisbeth Zwerger add new poignancy and charm to this simple tale about the rewards of unselfish love.</p><p>William Sydney Porter&#x2014;later to be known as O. Henry&#x2014;was born in North Carolina in 1862. Known for his surprise endings and ability to capture the hope and pathos of ordinary people, Henry is best remembered for his stories about New York City. <i>The Gift of the Magi</i> was written in 1906, four years before his death.<br><br>Lisbeth Zwerger has been accorded nearly every prize that can be given, including the highest international award for lifetime achievement, the Hans Christian Andersen Medal. Since 1981 she has devoted her extraordinary talents to children&#x2019;s literature, to stories as charming and picturesque as her native Vienna. Always surprising, always engaging, her artwork combines technical mastery with an insight and gentleness so rare and captivating that she has been correctly called one of the finest illustrators of the twentieth century.O. Henry's classic story has been embellished in this adaptation performed by the St. Charles Players. In this production, Della is rummaging through the attic on a Christmas Eve with her granddaughter. This brings back memories of a Christmas Eve many years before, and she tells the story of how she and Jim Dillingham met and courted, leading to the story we know so well. All of the performers in this work are splendid. Della, young and not so young, is vivacious and full of spunk. Jim is a confident, ambitious young man who is smitten by Della. Granddaughter cannot get enough of the story. While not faithful to the story in many respects (the setting, for example), this delightful and entertaining production is faithful to its spirit. M.T.F. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Magic of Awareness</h2><p>The paradox of awareness is very profound and yet very simple. It can&#39;t be described because it has no objective qualities and no limitation. Sometimes it comes naturally to the surface when we are fully in the present moment and no longer lost in thought or mental projections. Pure consciousness is neither high nor low, neither pleasant nor unpleasant, neither good nor bad. No matter where we are, no matter what we are doing, we always have an immediate access to that inner stillness. It can be experienced in an instant in all circumstances once we know how to pay attention to it. It is utterly peaceful and it is also insightful, so it sees through all illusions. Whenever there is a moment of being deluded, we can use that moment to practice settling in the very perfect sphere of the Buddha mind without trying to change anything. When we reside in that liberated mind, we find the very thing we have been seeking all along.</p><p>Anam Thubten grew up in Tibet and undertook Buddhist training in the Nyingma&nbsp; tradition at an early age. He has been teaching in the West since the 1990s and is the spiritual adviser and Dharma teacher for the Dharmata Foundation."The more awake we become, the more compassion will flow freely. Its quality is like water, gentle and soothing. At the same time, it has awesome power. It is the flowering of our consciousness. It allows us to connect deeply to others, to the point where the concept of separation loses all of its meaning."&#x2014;from The Magic of Awareness <br></p><h2>Fatale Volume 3: West of Hell</h2><p><ul> <li>From the dark days of the depression, to the middle ages and the old west, these tales of horror and myth and the mystery of the Femme Fatale reveal secrets even our heroine doesn't know about yet. Bold and experimental, this is pulp noir horror at its finest!</li> <li>Collects <i>Fatale </i>#11-14.</li></ul><br></p><p>As this Eisner-nominated series about an immortal&#x2014;or is she?&#x2014;femme continues, the narrative does even more time traveling, leaving behind a film-noir feel and edging closer to pure horror. The four stories here focus on the antiheroine&#x2019;s search for self-knowledge as we follow her and her predecessors through Dust Bowl Texas, medieval France, the Wild West, and WWII Europe. Tantalizing hints about the forces that spawned her and the unseen, Lovecraftian world that surrounds her are planted throughout the pages like so much delicious nerd bait. (Parsing various quotes and influences will prove irresistible to many readers.) Taken individually, these tales are terrifically told, with the dialogue and drawings working in perfect tandem, as befits Brubaker and Phillips&#x2019; productive partnership. For all her power over men, though, Jo (or Mathilda, or Bonnie) often finds herself in need of a Y-chromosome-�assisted rescue. One wonders about the dramatic possibilities should she, in a longer narrative, take fuller control over her destiny. Series fans will be eager to find out where and when she goes next. --Keir Graff</p><h2>Through Faith Alone</h2><p>Freshly translated from the original German into today&#39;s English, this book contains devotionals taken from Martin Luther&#39;s writings and sermons between 1513 and 1546.

The <i>Kunzang Nying-tig</i> by Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen is a powerful and practical instructional text, which cuts to the heart of Dzogchen meditation. Dzogchen is regarded by Bonpos as the highest and most esoteric religious practice.Written in the style of personal instruction from Shardza to his students, the manual is supplemented with a commentary by Lopon Tenzin Namdak who is himself an acknowledged master of Dzogchen. The translation was carried out by Lopon in the course of teaching the text to Western students at his monastery in the Kathmandu Valley. The book has four parts: preliminary practices, the practice of trekcho, the practice of togel and bardo, and phowa practices. Also included are a discussion of the rainbow body, a short history of B�n, and biographies of the authors.</p><p>Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen (1859&#x2013;1935) was born in the Kham region of Tibet. An unusually gifted child, he became a monk at age nine. At thirty-four he retired to a mountain hermitage where he passed the rest of his life in retreat, meditating, writing, and teaching students from both Buddhist and Bonpo backgrounds.Text: English, Tibetan (translation)<br> Original Language: Tibetan</p><h2>William Cowper&#39;s Olney Hymns</h2><p>These hymns were written in Olney, England and were originally published in 1779. This collection includes William Cowper's 68 Olney hymns, and twelve other sacred works. All of Cowper's most loved hymns are found here: "God Moves in Mysterious Ways," "There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood," and "O for a Closer Walk with God." This edition also contains a brief biographical sketch of William Cowper by Rev. Henry Stebbing, A. M. (1799-1883). All Bible references are complete text. Please note: The Olney Hymns (1779) were originally published without music. This edition is uniform with the first edition and contains no music. In those days hymns were sung using many different tunes that had the same meter. Music wasn&#x2019;t commonly published in hymnbooks until well into the 1800&#x2019;s.</p><p>WILLIAM COWPER (1731-1800) was born in Berkhampstead, England. Among his distinguished ancestors, his father was Chaplin to His Majesty George the Second. Mr. Cowper&#39;s sensitive soul was an advantage to his poetry, but he also endured much distress. Mr. John Newton, the preacher at Olney, requested that he give himself to hymn writing. He wrote many other poems as well, such as &#34;The Task&#34; and &#34;The Diverting History of John Gilpin.&#34;</p><h2>Electric Eden: Unearthing Britain&#39;s Visionary Music</h2><p><p>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Nonfiction of 2011 title </p><p>In the late 1960s, with popular culture hurtling forward on the sounds of rock music, some brave musicians looked back instead, trying to recover the lost treasures of English roots music and update them for the new age. The records of Fairport Convention, Pentangle, Steeleye Span, and Nick Drake are known as "folk rock" today, but Rob Young's epic, electrifying book makes clear that those musicians led a decades-long quest to recover English music-and with it, the ancient ardor for mysticism and paganism, for craftsmanship and communal living.</p><p>It is a commonplace that rock and R&amp;B came out of the folk and blues revivals of the early 1960s, and Young shows, through enchanting storytelling and brilliant commentary, that a similar revival in England inspired the Beatles and Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Traffic, Kate Bush and Talk Talk. Folklorists notated old songs and dances. Marxists put folk music forward as the true voice of the people. Composers like Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams devised rich neo-traditional pageantry. Today, the pioneers of the "acid folk" movement see this music as a model for their own.</p><br><p><i>Electric Eden </i>is that rare book which has something truly new to say about popular music, and like Greil Marcus's <i>Lipstick</i> <i>Traces</i>, it uses music to connect the dots in a thrilling story of art and society, of tradition and wild, idiosyncratic creativity.</p></p><p><p><b>Rob Young</b>, who was the editor of <i>The Wire</i>, the leading British music magazine, is now an editor at large there. He lives in London.</p>ELECTRIC EDEN (1: The Inward Exodus) <p>The battered Austin, its fifty years clearly legible in rust and mud flecks, slowed to a halt, the motor spluttering on its empty fuel tank. The doors spread their wings and two of its three occupants emerged onto the country road, taking stock of their position among the hedgerows before rolling up their sleeves to push the vehicle, while the third, a slight female, took hold of the wheel in the driver&#x2019;s seat. As the tyres bit against the rough tarmac and the car began to move off, one of them, Robert, caught sight of something glinting behind the thorny hedgerow. He called to his friend John to stop pushing for a moment, and to his girlfriend Vashti to apply the handbrake. She climbed out of the car and together they vaulted the gate.</p><p>It was a Gypsy caravan, or more accurately, an old baker&#x2019;s delivery cart, constructed from tin sheets covered with fading brown paint. A curved roof crowned it, and its wheels, which looked as if they had been taken off a vintage motor car, were mounted on a buckling chassis. How many miles had this unroadworthy jalopy already travelled? The three friends could not tell, but they set off down the short path in search of its owner. He was soon found: a Gypsy, or as he himself styled it, a Romany, sitting with his pots and pans and keeping his horse, Bess, company.</p><p>His wandering life appealed to Robert Lewis and Vashti Bunyan at just that moment in their lives. Until their friend John James&#x2019;s car had run out of petrol, they had been fleeing from their last home, a camp in a clearing in some Kentish woods, where they had been living for several months among piles of home-made wooden stools and tables, log fires, bivouacs and hammocks. The clearing was decorated with Lewis&#x2019;s giant sheet paintings, part of the art diploma he was enrolled in at Ravensbourne College of Art, near Chislehurst on the fringes of south-east London. The land was just at the back of the college, and in 1967, with a few weeks to go before his time was up, Lewis strung up a bivouac under a giant rhododendron, hung more sections of canvas between trees and bushes, and began executing a series of paintings in the outdoors. In the late spring, his girlfriend Vashti resigned her post as an assistant in a veterinary practice in Hammersmith, picked up a blanket, a pillow, her guitar and her dog Blue, and boarded a bus bound for Chislehurst. Was he pleased to see her or did he fear that the introduction of a live-in partner in his woodland idyll would jeopardise his diploma prospects? Whatever his initial feelings, the pair made a little haven of their forest home, constructing rude furniture from felled branches and logs and singing Vashti&#x2019;s simple songs around the campfire in a small and picturesque clearing. As Lewis daubed his canvases, Bunyan sat on his mildewed mattress with her feet on a patch of threadbare carpet and sewed curtains for their rudimentary bush dwelling by the light of an oil lamp. &#x2018;We made a little heaven in the wood,&#x2019; she said many years later.</p><p>Pilgrims&#x2019; progress: Vashti Bunyan, her dog Blue, horse Bess and Robert Lewis on the road to Skye, 1969.</p><p>Vashti Bunyan&#x2019;s drawing of herself and Robert Lewis camping in woods near Ravensbourne College, 1967. Note approaching bailiffs.</p><p>But the spell in the sylvan paradise did not last more than a few weeks. A banishing god appeared in the form of a suited Bank of England official, representing the true owners of the land, flanked by two policemen to enforce the eviction. They clutched a summons Robert Lewis had previously received &#x2013; for taking a pillion passenger on his motorbike without a licence &#x2013; and the wonk from the bank added an admonishing lecture about the breakdown of civil order if everybody suddenly decided to go and live in their wood. Frogmarched to the edge of the forest, they telephoned John James with news of their plight, and after some minutes his Austin came rattling around to pick them up.</p><p>Her name &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s her real one &#x2013; is almost too perfect. Vashti comes from the Old Testament&#x2019;s Book of Esther: a Persian queen banished for refusing to dance in front of her husband&#x2019;s guests. The Bunyan family have never proved any lineage to the seventeenth-century author of The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress, but the name is richly evocative of quests in search of paradise. Bunyan herself was no stranger to the milieu of the music business. On a trip to New York when she was eighteen, she found a copy of The Freewheelin&#x2019; Bob Dylan and became hooked on the singer&#x2019;s music, and quickly developed an intense desire to become a successful pop singer. She won a place at the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford, but spent a whole term skiving off her lectures, instead teaching herself to play the guitar, writing songs and becoming lost in a world of music. When she tried to pass off this non-attendance as a different and valid form of art, her supervisors were not amused and in 1964 she was slung out.</p><p>The following year, she met Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham through an actress friend of her mother&#x2019;s. The svengali was practically the same age and soon developed a crush on Vashti, but could not bring himself to declare it.1 He signed her up to fill the gap left by Marianne Faithfull, who had just left his stable, giving her a song written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, &#x2018;Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind&#x2019;, as her first single on the Decca label. &#x2018;I wanted to be a pop singer,&#x2019; she admitted later. &#x2018;There was no way Andrew Oldham took this innocent folk singer and tried to mould her into a pop singer, that wasn&#x2019;t what happened at all. I was ready and willing...&#x2019; She was a female singer with her own songbook, which, she recalls, was unusual. &#x2018;There weren&#x2019;t many female singers who wrote their own songs. Whenever I knocked on doors, they were looking for people in sequins and ballgowns, not a skinny art student with an old jumper with holes in it and a guitar slung over her shoulder.&#x2019; Vashti, however, fought against the standard practice of women singers singing other (men&#x2019;s) songs, and the B-side of that first single contained a composition of her own, &#x2018;I Want to Be Alone&#x2019;.</p><p>Perhaps that song expressed a sentiment that made her unfit for massive pop stardom. In 1966, apparently shaking her head one day and looking at the predominantly sad tenor of the songs she was writing (or stung by the comments of others), she and her friend Jenny Lewis came up with a throwaway tune called &#x2018;Seventeen Pink Sugar Elephants&#x2019;. A Canadian producer, Peter Snell, surfaced out of nowhere and bought her out of her contract with Oldham&#x2019;s Immediate label, hoping to sprinkle his own stardust on her. The poet Alasdair Clayre had begun sending lyrics for her to set to music, and her &#x2018;Pink Sugar Elephants&#x2019; tune fitted the words of a piece of his called &#x2018;Train Song&#x2019;. When this found its way onto a single, it received almost no airplay and failed to puncture the charts. Some months later, Immediate co-founder Tony Calder managed to sweet-talk Vashti back to the studio, which proved to be a waste of time, commercially speaking. &#x2018;Winter Is Blue&#x2019;, despite its recording session being filmed by Peter Whitehead for his hip documentary Tonite Let&#x2019;s All Make Love in London, and eventually re-recorded by Oldham himself, never came out; neither did &#x2018;Coldest Night of the Year&#x2019;, sung by Vashti with the boy duo Twice As Much; nor her own &#x2018;I&#x2019;d Like to Walk Around Inside Your Mind&#x2019;, which Oldham complained needed a string section and more dramatic production, only no one could be bothered. That was Vashti&#x2019;s Summer of Love; the following year, 1968, she dropped into a spiral of depression during which she walked away from the metropolitan music business. &#x2018;That was the nosedive time, when I realised that I had to get out of London.&#x2019;</p><p>She had encountered Robert Lewis in 1965 when, driving through the Suffolk countryside in the middle of the night, she picked him up as he was hitch-hiking. They kept in touch but it wasn&#x2019;t until two years later that she discovered he was camping in the woods in the grounds of his art college.</p><p>Which is how they found themselves marooned halfway home with a broken-down car, with an open future, staring transfixed at this house on wheels, their minds whirring with new possibilities. Two weeks later they came up with the money to buy the cart and the horse from its Romany owner down there in the field. The cash was lent to them by Donovan Leitch, whose reputation as the Grand Vizier of the British hippy folk scene was at its height. One of Robert&#x2019;s college friends knew Donovan, and they began hanging out with the singer and his circle. Once the cart was purchased, they repaired to the singer&#x2019;s small cottage in Essex to make it roadworthy.</p><p>Donovan&#x2019;s success after the Dylan-influenced singles such as &#x2018;Catch the Wind&#x2019;, &#x2018;Colours&#x2019; and &#x2018;Universal Soldier&#x2019; was in part due to some steerage by his new producer/svengali Mickie Most, who had urged the young artist to trick out his acoustic folkiness with generous helpings from the new palette of psychedelic colours creeping into pop production in the wake of such records as The Beatles&#x2019; Revolver and The Kinks&#x2019; Face to Face. In 1965 he was still immersed in the Woody Guthrie/Dylan knock-off protest folk of his first LP, What&#x2019;s Bin Did and What&#x2019;s Bin Hid, while on his second, Fairytale, he began to inch towards a more bucolic mode with the inclusion of &#x2018;Jersey Thursday&#x2019; and &#x2018;Summer Day Reflection Song&#x2019;.

She trained as an art historian and taught at the Courtauld Institute of Art until 1988.&nbsp;<br><i><br></i>In another quietly brilliant gem, the incomparably subtle Brookner (Altered States, 1997, etc.) puts soft, revealing touches on the face of loneliness as only the elderly know it. As in her recent A Private View (1995), the predicament of the aging is highlighted through generational contrast and conflict, although here the protagonist is female, while the youth who rocks her boat is all but sexless. Thea May is a woman of propriety, from her neat hair down to her sensible shoes. Widowed for 15 years after having married late, she's lived much of her life alone in London, and contacts with her late husband's well-to-do family, to whom she was never close for a variety of reasons, have become so ritualized by her aloofness as to barely ruffle the surface of her existence. When sister-in-law Kitty calls to ask for help in an unusual way, though, by putting up--for a week at least--the best man before her granddaughter's unexpected wedding, still waters begin to churn. And when Steve, a polite drifter with no plans for the future, moves in, Thea feels a shift in the wind even as she struggles against it. Steve and his friends might as well be visitors from another planet, so entirely do their views differ from those of Thea and Kitty's generation. But the preparations go on apace, as Thea, in spite of herself, comes to see refracted in Steve's rootlessness something strangely familiar. By the day of the wedding he's out of her life, at her insistence, but the inner turmoil he's created remains. Impulsively, Thea plans to travel herself--only to change her mind as good sense and habit regain control. Signaling profound upheaval with the slightest turn of phrase and imparting wisdom through the most trivial detail, Brookner continues her long, nuanced look at human isolation. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

THE JAMES BOND OMNIBUS collects eleven of Ian Fleming's original daily comic strips for the very first time in a mammoth omnibus edition.<br><br>Including the stories: CASINO ROYALE, LIVE AND LET DIE, MOONRAKER, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, DR. NO, GOLDFINGER, FROM A VIEW TO A KILL, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and THUNDERBALL.</p><p>In 1958, just five years after Fleming published the first James Bond novel and long before the supersuave spy became a worldwide phenom, Britain&#x2019;s Daily Express began running comic-strip versions of the Bond novels and occasional short stories. The strip presented the stories in publication chronology, boosted the newspaper&#x2019;s sales, and is said to have contributed greatly to the British Bondmania that prompted the long-lived movie series. The comic ran original stories after exhausting the Fleming originals and thus continued to 1983. This collection includes adaptations of 11 Bond adventures, from 1953&#x2019;s Casino Royale to 1961&#x2019;s Thunderball. These visual condensations follow the originals&#x2019; story lines to a far greater extent than did the frequently outlandish films. In the mode of British comics of the era, they&#x2019;re rather stiff and understated compared to their more vivid American contemporaries. Nevertheless, they demonstrate uncanny prescience in that artist John McClusky&#x2019;s Bond markedly resembles Sean Connery (the strip emerged four years before the first film, Dr. No). --Gordon Flagg"for fans of both the movies and the books this collection will be a great read...it's an entertaining new way to rediscover the adventures of the world's most famous spy" - --Ain't It Cool News<br><br>The James Bond Omnibus is the perfect thing for not just James Bond fanatics but also anybody who loves comic books... --Crave Online</p><h2>Green Girl: A Novel (P.S.)</h2><p><p>With the fierce emotional and intellectual power of such classics as Jean Rhys's <em>Good Morning, Midnight</em>, Sylvia Plath's <em>The Bell Jar</em>, and Clarice Lispector's <em>The Hour of the Star</em>, Kate Zambreno's novel <em>Green Girl</em> is a provocative, sharply etched portrait of a young woman navigating the spectrum between anomie and epiphany.</p><p>First published in 2011 in a small press edition, <em>Green Girl</em> was named one of the best books of the year by critics including Dennis Cooper and Roxane Gay.

This summer it is being republished in an all-new Harper Perennial trade paperback, significantly revised by the author, and including an extensive P.S. section including never before published outtakes, an interview with the author, and a new essay by Zambreno.</p><p>Zambreno's heroine, Ruth, is a young American in London, kin to Jean Seberg gamines and contemporary celebutantes, by day spritzing perfume at the department store she calls Horrids, by night trying desperately to navigate a world colored by the unwanted gaze of others and the uncertainty of her own self-regard. Ruth, the green girl, joins the canon of young people existing in that important, frightening, and exhilarating period of drift and anxiety between youth and adulthood, and her story is told through the eyes of one of the most surprising and unforgettable narrators in recent fiction&#x2014;a voice at once distanced and maternal, indulgent yet blackly funny.

At 11 he was instructed to quit dreaming, and he went to work for his father on the land. "I was paid thirty dollars a month, had my own bed in the bunkhouse, and three large, plain meals each day." The ranch is a sprawling place where winter brings months of solitude and summer brings tourists from the real world--city types who want a taste of the outdoors and stare at the author and his family as if they were members of some exotic tribe: "Our guests were New Jersey gas station owners, New York congressmen, Iowa farmers, judges, actors, plumbers, Europeans who had read of Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull and came to experience the American West, the retired, the just beginning." By the age of 14, he and his younger brother are leading them on camping trips into deep woods. "No one ever asked why we had no televisions, no daily paper. They came for what my brother and I took for granted. They came to live the anachronism that we considered our normal lives."<p> As Spragg comes to realize the strangeness of his life, he also detects flaws in his own character--a fear of suffering and mortality that first shows itself when he rides a sick horse too hard, until the animal hovers at the brink of death. He knows that if he had faced the possibility of sickness, if he had been brave, this animal would not have declined so quickly. Throughout his life, this inability to face death, this terror of losing the beauty of the world he so passionately witnesses, drives Spragg to distraction.</p><p> <i>Where Rivers Change Direction</i> combines a soaring spirituality with a visceral, often stomach-churning attention to detail. It's a book that continually dares the reader to turn away from its pages in an effort to digest the power of its confused emotions and hauntingly spare images (a "moon-fried plain," a stillborn child "baked alive in my mother's body").

This testimony, concerning Auschwitz and the atrocities which were enacted there, has been edited and extracted by Peter Weiss into a dramatic document that relies solely and completely on the facts for its effectiveness.<br><br>There is no artistic license, no manipulation of facts and figures, no rearrangement of events for theatrical effect. Nameless witnesses stand and recall their appalling memories of Auschwitz, allowing us to bear witness to their painful and painstaking search for truth and, ultimately, justice. What emerges is a chastening and purging documentary of deeply moving power.<br><br>Peter Weiss was born in 1916 and settled in Sweden before the outbreak of World War II. Apart from his writing, he was also well known as a painter, theatrical and operatic director, and a film maker.

But in a world of busy and isolated lives, in which friendships can too easily become shallow, tenuous, and homogeneous, Dana Robert insists that good friendships are a vital and transformative part of the Christian life&#x2014;a mustard seed of the kingdom of God. She believes Christians have the responsibility&#x2014;and opportunity&#x2014;to be countercultural by making friends across cultural, racial, socioeconomic, and religious lines that separate people from each other.</p><p>In this book Robert tells the stories of Christians who, despite or even because of difficult circumstances, experienced friendship with people unlike themselves as &#x201c;God with us,&#x201d; as exile, as testimony, and as celebration.</p><p>Jesus was a&nbsp;<i>friend&nbsp;</i>to his disciples.

She brings her deep knowledge of Christian mission and her own spiritual journey into a reflection about how relationships that seem so unequal to others can be deep and forming friendships that extend across great differences.

Wyndham is a compelling, true spiritual adventure story that takes place in a Japanese prison camp on Java during the Second World War. The author, a prisoner of war for three years, was first considered a spy and was about to be executed. He prayed for divine direction and was given an unexpected answer which saved his own life, changed the lives of others and even brought about amazing experiences with his captors. Many true stories have been told, such as &#34;Unbroken,&#34; and this one is not only true, but enters a new dimension of war experience. The spiritual dimension the author had recourse to is what sets this account apart from all others. The spiritual adventure continues after the war with issues of employment and income being solved through the author&#39;s spiritual resources. The account of ANZAC Day alone will astound and move you to tears! A must-read war story!</p><p>John H. Wyndham, a Dutch-born officer with the Royal Australian Air Force, was a prisoner of war for three years on the island of Java during the Second World War. How he dealt with this, and how he later became engaged in a successful business, makes for inspiring reading. His lifelong, ardent desire to bless mankind further took him across the world and even to serving with the United Nations. He was UNICEF&#x2019;s Assistant Director of Public Information in New York, and then UNICEF&#x2019;s Director of Public Information for Europe, based in Paris. John Wyndham later became a citizen of the United States and a worldwide lecturer on the subject of spiritual healing and spiritual solutions. His ten years of lecture tours included travel all over the United States, and to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, and Africa, speaking in English, Dutch, German and Afrikaans. From African villages to Carnegie Hall, his lectures were warmly welcomed and, many years later, are still well remembered. These lectures may be found in the book, The Spiritual Pathway to Freedom.</p><h2>The Day I Became a Bird</h2><p>The day he starts school, a young boy falls in love for the very first time. Sylvia sits in front of him at school, and he's so in love with her, she's all he can see. But sadly, Sylvia doesn't see him. In fact, it seems the only thing Sylvia has eyes for is birds. ?There are birds on her pants and dresses. She wears bird barrettes in her hair. She draws birds on her notebooks and folders. And when she speaks, her voice sounds like birdsong.? So in a bold attempt to get Sylvia's attention, the boy decides to go to school dressed up as a bird. He endures the stares and giggles of his classmates, and a great deal of discomfort, but the boy doesn't care. Because when it comes to love, sometimes you have no choice but to follow your heart and spread your wings. <br><br>In this sweetly funny picture book, Ingrid Chabbert perfectly captures the emotional essence of a child's first love. The boy's voice as narrator is realistic and endearing as he engagingly and honestly shares the wonder of his experience. With imagination and gentle humor, Guridi uses spare lines in mostly black and white drawings to tenderly express the poignant heart of the story. This book offers a terrific exploration of young children's self-discovery and self-expression, as well as the early development of social skills. It makes a wonderful read-aloud to launch a classroom discussion about relationships and feelings.</p><p><b>Ingrid Chabbert</b> is a children's author and graphic novel writer with dozens of books to her name.

On the day he first starts school, a young boy falls in love with the girl who sits right in front of him, but Sylvia is an avian lover and has eyes only for birds. Suddenly, the things the boy used to enjoy just don&#39;t seem important anymore. Desperate to attract her attention, he constructs a bird costume. In it, he feels handsome and warm, though it does make it hard to climb trees, and he smells like wet dog when it rains. His classmates giggle and stare, but then one day Sylvia sees him and it&#39;s worth it all. Delicate and slightly surreal pencil drawings follow the young protagonist through this sweet tale with cinematic precision. The poetic text has a dreamy cadence as it flows through the pages. The young narrator&#39;s affection for Sylvia is innocent and endearing, and readers will join him in rejoicing when she finally sees him.

Are black children "brand-crazed consumer addicts" willing to kill each other over a pair of the latest Nike Air Jordans or Barbie backpack? In this first in-depth account of the consumer lives of poor and working-class black children, Elizabeth Chin enters the world of children living in hardship in order to understand the ways they learn to manage living poor in a wealthy society.<p>To move beyond the stereotypical images of black children obsessed with status symbols, Chin spent two years interviewing poor children in New Haven, Connecticut, about where and how they spend their money. An alternate image of the children emerges, one that puts practicality ahead of status in their purchasing decisions. On a twenty-dollar shopping spree with Chin, one boy has to choose between a walkie-talkie set and an X-Men figure. In one of the most painful moments of her research, Chin watches as Davy struggles with his decision. He finally takes the walkie-talkie set, a toy that might be shared with his younger brother.</p><p>Through personal anecdotes and compelling stories ranging from topics such as Christmas and birthday gifts, shopping malls, Toys-R-Us, neighborhood convenience shops, school lunches, ethnically correct toys, and school supplies, Chin critically examines consumption as a medium through which social inequalities -- most notably of race, class, and gender -- are formed, experienced, imposed, and resisted. Along the way she acknowledges the profound constraints under which the poor and working class must struggle in their daily lives.</p></p><p>fm.author_biographical_note2Has both vitality and immediacy.Chin's vignettes from life with the kids are touching, funny, troubling, strange, and familiar. -- <i>Ruminator Review</i></p><h2>Animal Tracking Basics</h2><p><li>Offers expert instruction and in-the-field advice for the novice and experienced tracker<p>Tracking wildlife successfully requires more than just looking for trails and scat.

McKillip, the 21st century's response to Hans Christian Andersen, has mastered the art of writing fairy tales -- as evidenced by previous works like <i>The Tower at Stony Wood, Ombria in Shadow,</i> and <i>In the Forests of Serre</i>. <i>Alphabet of Thorn</i> is yet another timeless fable suitable for children and adults alike.<p>In the kingdom of Raine, a vast realm at the edge of the world, an orphaned baby girl is found by a palace librarian and raised to become a translator. Years later, the girl -- named Nepenthe -- comes in contact with a mysterious book written in a language of thorns that no one, not even the wizards at Raine's famous Floating School for mages, can decipher. The book calls out to Nepenthe's very soul, and she is soon privately translating its contents. As she works tirelessly transcribing the book -- which turns out to be about the historical figures of Axis, the Emperor of Night, and Kane, his masked sorcerer -- the kingdom of Raine is teetering on the brink of chaos. The newly crowned queen, a mousy 14-year old girl named Tessera who wants nothing to do with matters of state, hides in the woods as regents plot revolution. The queen's destiny, however, is intertwined with Nepenthe's ability to unravel the mystery of the thorns.</p></p><p>Patricia A. McKillip is one of America's greatest fantasy authors. Her best known novels include <i>Riddle-Master</i>; World Fantasy Award winner <i>The Forgotten Beasts of Eld</i>; World Fantasy Award and Mythopoeic Award winner <i>Ombria in Shadow</i>; and <i>In the Forests of Serre</i>. Like its predecessors, <i>Alphabet of Thorn</i> demonstrates McKillip's mastery of prose and her knowledge of the human heart.<p> As an infant, Nepenthe was abandoned by her mother on the edge of a cliff so high no one can hear the sea below. Nepenthe was raised by the librarians of the Royal Library of Raine, and knows little of the outside world beyond what she reads. She has a gift for translation, and she alone has a chance of translating a newly arrived book, a mysterious tome written in an alien alphabet that resembles thorns. But Nepenthe has fallen in love with the high-born student-mage who brings her the book. And the thorns are exerting a strange power over her--a magic that may destroy not only Nepenthe, but the kingdom of Raine and the entire world. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Patricia A.

In one sonnet, R�os addresses injustice in the borderlands, capturing with mathematical precision the everyday struggles that many migrants face 'The border is an equation in search of an equals sign.' A series of sonnets about desert flora abounds with fantastic, magical imagery 'Bougainvilleas do not bloom they bleed' and 'Apricots are eggs laid in trees by invisible golden hens.' Likewise, R�os's bestiary sonnets overflow with inimitable similes, worthy of a book unto themselves 'Minnows are where a river&#x2019;s leg has fallen asleep' and 'Gnats are sneezes still flying around.'

Mr. Pinkney and his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, live in New York.</p>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Sophie's grandfather lives in her house, and while his mobility is restricted, his tender feelings for his granddaughter know no bounds. He waves her off to school from his second-floor window, and she comes to visit him every afternoon. Their daily routine includes the man asking for the child's help in retrieving an everyday object that has somehow "gone missing." All of the items are in plain sight, if, that is, one knows where to look. Bright-eyed Sophie is always up for the challenge and is thorough and methodical as she searches through Grandpa's room&#x2014;neat but chock-full of a busy lifetime of acquired books and mementos&#x2014;to locate the paper clip, rubber band, straw, or paintbrush. Sharp-eyed viewers will glean that this man, now in a wheelchair, was once a soldier and an athlete and reads poetry and paints. The simple text is largely made up of the good-natured conversations that surround the game and reflect the warmth and joy that Sophie and Grandpa find in each other. Pinkney's lush and lovely watercolors are by turns delicate, energetic, and effusive as he captures his engaging African American characters and their homey domicile.

It is the result of multiple lapses on the part of human beings and political institutions that, in failing to listen well to survivors, deny them redress by negating their testimony and thwarting their claims for justice. <br><br>Jill Stauffer examines the root causes of ethical loneliness and how those in power revise history to serve their own ends rather than the needs of the abandoned. Out of this discussion, difficult truths about the desire and potential for political forgiveness, transitional justice, and political reconciliation emerge. Moving beyond a singular focus on truth commissions and legal trials, she considers more closely what is lost in the wake of oppression and violence, how selves and worlds are built and demolished, and who is responsible for re-creating lives after they are destroyed. <br><br>Stauffer boldly argues that rebuilding worlds and just institutions after violence is a broad obligation and that those who care about justice must first confront their own assumptions about autonomy, liberty, and responsibility before an effective response to violence can take place. In building her claims, Stauffer draws on the work of Emmanuel Levinas, Jean Am�ry, Eve Sedgwick, and Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as concrete cases of justice and injustice across the world.</p><p>Stauffer examines difficult truths about the desire and potential for political forgiveness, transitional justice, and political reconciliation.

It examines the roots of fear - the fear of change, of self-disclosure, of giving and receiving, of being alone. Beneath all of these is the greatest fear of all: the fear of love. Psychologist David Richo has charted a path that can free us from the grip of fear. He suggests things to do that will help us to love even when we&#39;re afraid. The way to gain power over fear, he says, is first to become defenseless. When, despite our trepidation, we embrace our weakness, we can no longer be wounded, and fear loses its hold over us.David Richo, PhD, is a psychotherapist, teacher, writer, and workshop leader whose work emphasizes the benefits of mindfulness and loving-kindness in personal growth and emotional well-being.

Kara Keeling explores how the speculative fictions of cinema, music, and literature that center black existence provide scenarios wherein we might imagine alternative worlds, queer and otherwise. In doing so, Keeling offers a sustained meditation on contemporary investments in futurity, speculation, and technology, paying particular attention to their significance to queer and black freedom.<br><br>Keeling reads selected works, such as Sun Ra&#x2019;s 1972 film <i>Space is the Place</i> and the 2005 film <i>The Aggressives</i>, to juxtapose the Afrofuturist tradition of speculative imagination with the similar &#x201c;speculations&#x201d; of corporate and financial institutions. In connecting a queer, cinematic reordering of time with the new possibilities technology offers, Keeling thinks with and through a vibrant conception of the imagination as a gateway to queer times and black futures, and the previously unimagined spaces that they can conjure.</p></p><p><b>Kara Keeling</b> is Associate Professor of Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Chicago. Keeling is the author of <i>The Witch&#x2019;s Flight: The Cinematic, the Black Femme, and the Image of Common Sense</i> (2007) and the co-editor (with Josh Kun) of a selection of writings about sound and American Studies entitled <i>Sound Clash: Listening to American Studies</i>, and (with Colin MacCabe and Cornel West) of <i>European Pedigrees/African Contagions: Racist Traces and Other Writing</i>, a selection of writings by the late James A. Snead."Not satisfied to leave readers in the abyss of endless critique, Keeling is concerned with alternative futures and the ethical imagination of 'the time after the future.' <i>Queer Times, Black Futures</i> is masterful--deeply engaging, wide ranging, carefully researched, and creative in its use of allegory to demonstrate the potential and effect of opacity for black futures and possibilities."<br><br>"Just when the world seems to be collapsing, <i>Queer Times, Black Futures</i> guides us towards an anti-fragile future that exists here and now. The key? Embracing and holding in tension: Afro-futurist freedom dreams, the queer temporalities that animate Black Swans, and the radical refusal and opacity of Herman Melville's Bartleby and Eduoard Glissant's philosophy. If we haven't realized the possibilities that lie waiting in the present, its because the frame of black experience has not yet registered. Moving seamlessly from James Snead to Sun Ra, from Gilbert Simondon to Beth Coleman, Audre Lorde to Gilles Deleuze, Keeling helps us imagine the (im)possible.

And there is a vast world of varieties that goes beyond the common grocery store offerings of Red Delicious and Granny Smith. With names like American Beauty, Carter&#x2019;s Blue, and Fallawater, and flavors ranging from sweet to tart, this treasure trove of unique apples is ripe for discovery.<br><br> There is no better guide through this tasty world than Tom Burford, whose family has grown apples in the Blue Ridge Mountains since 1715. The book is brimming with beautiful portraits of heirloom and modern apples of merit, each accompanied by distinguishing characteristics and common uses. As the view broadens to the orchard, you will find information on planting, pruning, grafting, and more. The exploration of the apple culminates with an overview of the fruit&#x2019;s transformative capabilities when pressed, fermented, cooked, or dried.&nbsp;Beyond the polished and predictable grocery store display of Red Delicious and Granny Smith apples, a feast&nbsp;of beautiful and uniquely flavored North American varieties awaits the curious.</p></p><p><b>&#x201c;A guide for the beginner and a master class for the expert&#x2014;a great harvest of wisdom.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Roger B.

The captivating photographs will transport you from American Beauty to York&#x2014;and all the sugary, spicy, sprightly apples in between. You&#x2019;ll learn about varieties brought back from the edge of extinction, the apple Tom calls &#x201c;the beauty queen of the russet apple world,&#x201d; and a fruit with skin so deeply red that it earned the name Arkansas Black.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Written with heartfelt enthusiasm, the diverse stories behind these apples are matched only by their range of shapes and colors, textures and flavors. The book goes below the surface too. Whether you are planting a backyard orchard, experimenting with grafting, or considering a batch of apple butter, the information in the orchard primer will get you started. This start-to-finish celebration of the apple is as important as it is lovely.<br> &nbsp;<p>Tom Burford, &#x201c;Professor Apple,&#x201d; is a horticulturist, orchardist, and nurseryman.

Trump to the presidency shocked the political establishment, triggering a wave of hysteria among the bicoastal elite that may never subside. The biggest shockwaves of all, however, were felt not in the progressive parishes of Manhattan or San Francisco, but in the halls of the political elite&#x2019;s cherished and oft-overlooked center of power&#x2015;Washington, DC&#x2019;s sprawling &#x201c;administrative state&#x201d;&#x2015;for President Trump represented an existential threat to its denizens, who came to be known as &#x201c;swamp creatures.&#x201d; <br><br> How did it come to pass that the &#x201c;draining of the swamp&#x201d; would become a core aim of the Trump administration, impacting everything from judicial appointments to the federal budget and regulatory policy? Marini&#x2019;s unmasking of the administrative state goes beyond bureaucracy or legalism to its core in an intellectual elite whose consensus transcends whatever disagreements flare up. The universities, the media, and think-tanks that denounce Trump are its heart. <br><br> The answer to this question and many more lies in the underappreciated but revolutionary scholarship of Professor John Marini, collected in his new book, <i>Unmasking the Administrative State</i>, which tells the critical missed story of the last century of political history: The ascendance of the theory behind and resultant growth of an administrative state that has supplanted limited constitutional government with the tyranny of unbounded anticonstitutional bureaucracy. <br><br> Marini illustrates the existential threat of the administrative state to our republic, exposes the regressive philosophy from which it springs, and argues for the reassertion of the founding principles to restore self-government. The Trump administration may be the best chance to apply the lessons of Marini&#x2019;s life&#x2019;s work and seize this remarkable opportunity to restore power to its rightful owners: the American people.</p><p>John Marini is a professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Reno. He received his PhD in government at the Claremont Graduate University and has also taught at Ohio University and the University of Dallas. During the Reagan administration, he served as a Special Assistant to then-Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Justice Clarence Thomas. Professor Marini was Justice Thomas&#x2019;s self-described first mentor on the American Constitution. <br><br> He is a Senior Fellow of the Claremont Institute in California and has been a member of the Nevada Advisory Committee of the US Civil Rights Commission. In addition to his pioneering work on the administrative state, Professor Marini is the author of numerous popular and scholarly articles on politics, political theory, and film, especially the films of John Ford. He is also the author or editor of several books, including <i>The Progressive Revolution in Politics and Political Science: Transforming the American Regime</i>; <i>The Imperial Congress: Crisis in the Separation of Powers</i>; <i>The Politics of Budget Control: Congress, the Presidency, and the Growth of the Administrative State</i>; and <i>The Founders on Citizenship and Immigration. He was awarded the Claremont Institute&#x2019;s Henry Salvatori Prize in the American Founding in 2011. In 2013, he served as the Distinguished Resident Fellow at the Kirby Center for Constitutional Studies in Washington, DC. </i>&#x201c;John Marini and Ken Masugi have led consequential lives, much of those lives together. They learned together in Claremont. They worked together for the great Clarence Thomas. They were among the earliest to explain the nature and the dangers of the modern administrative state.&nbsp;They continue that work in this book&#x2015;an achievement of decades.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Larry P. Arnn, President of Hillsdale College<br><br> &#x201c;John Marini vividly portrays the collapse of the Constitution and its consequences for ordinary citizens and the way they lead their lives. But we must take heart that the administrative state that has replaced the old Constitution may yet be contested, with the aid of scholars such as Marini.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Mark Levin<br><br> &#x201c;When I was at EEOC I hired Ken Masugi and John Marini&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and that began this wonderful intellectual journey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;studying how the structure of the Constitution protects individual liberty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;We debated at length the implications of natural-law thinking and speculated on how it might apply to contemporary political discussions. These arguments stimulated my mind in a way that no discussion of current events could possibly hope to equal.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Justice Clarence Thomas<br><br> &#x201c;This . . . wide-ranging and erudite book . . . moves easily from history to political theory to constitutional law. The author&#x2019;s journey runs from the framers through Tocqueville, the Progressives, Roosevelt, and Reagan, right up to Trump, with plenty of enlightening detours along the way.&nbsp;And if you think that nineteenth-century German philosophers could not possibly have anything to do with the rise and rise of the administrative state, read this book and see if it makes you think again.&#x201d;<br> &#x2015;Gary Lawson, the Philip S.

Duguid</b></p><h2>The English Major: A Novel</h2><p>It used to be Cliff and Vivian and now it isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; With these words, Jim Harrison begins a riotous, moving novel that sends a sixty-something man, divorced and robbed of his farm by a late-blooming real estate shark of an ex-wife, on a road trip across America. Cliff is armed with a childhood puzzle of the United States and a mission to rename all the states and state birds, the latter of which have been unjustly saddled with white men&#x2019;s banal monikers up until now. His adventures take him through a whirlwind affair with a former student from his high-school-teacher days twenty-some years before, to a snake farm&#x201d; in Arizona owned by an old classmate, and to the high-octane existence of his son, a big-time movie producer who has just bought an apartment over the Presidio in San Francisco. Now in paperback, Jim Harrison&#x2019;s riotous and moving cross-country novel, <i>The English Major</i>, is the map of a man&#x2019;s journey into, and out of, himself. It is vintage Harrison reflective, big-picture American, and replete with wicked wit.</p><p><p><b>Jim Harrison </b>(1937-2016) was the author of over thirty-five books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall</i>, <i>The Road Home</i>, <i> The English Major</i>, and <i>The Farmer's Daughter</i>.

He earned a National Endowment for the Arts grant, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Spirit of the West Award from the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Association. His work has been recognized worldwide and published in twenty-two languages.</p>The title of Jim Harrison&#39;s latest novel, THE ENGLISH MAJOR, could lead someone to expect a military story. But this is about a guy who majored in English in college and became a farmer. Really. Odd title aside, this story of a man who gives up the farm and wanders the country is a wonderful piece of work. Narrator Mark Bramhall is the epitome of the rural farmer. His voice, his inflections, his astonishment at the ways of city folk make it easy to ride with Cliff on an American road trip as he tries to forget the wife who abruptly divorced him and sold the farm out from under him. Bramhall&#39;s sometimes hushed tones mask the character&#39;s world of torment and desire to scream out loud.

Studying to be a concert pianist, she quit music the day she was introduced to rock climbing. Later, she abandoned the respectability of university life and pursuit of a law degree to become a "dirtbag climber," living out of her grandmother's hand-me-down Oldsmobile sedan with Fletcher, a heeler mix dog. Today, through courage and perseverance, Davis is a high-profile athlete whose sponsors have included Patagonia, Mammut, Clif Bar, Five Ten and Cascade Designs.<br>In <i>High Infatuation</i>, Davis writes on the universal themes of life, love, friendship, personal empowerment, and more, told through a career in climbing. We wait with her in the tent through weeks of rain, wind, snow, and sleet, hoping for the weather to improve in the mountains of Patagonia, then race with her up a towering rock wall of Yosemite's El Capitan in a single day. More than adventure stories, these pieces reveal Davis' soul. They draw us into her struggles with safety, independence, ambition, and compassion. By following the journey of this remarkable woman, we learn what it means to live a truly adventurous life. <br></p><p><p><b>STEPH DAVIS</b> is on record with first ascents in Pakistan, Patagonia, Baffin Island, and Kyrgyzstan.

And her heartfelt insight into the struggles and decisions that have informed that life is a gift to any reader."

The twin forces of mass higher education and the global knowledge economy have driven an unprecedented transformation. These fundamental changes have pulled in opposite directions: one pushes for wider access and accompanying challenges of quality, the other toward exclusive, "world class" research-oriented universities. </p><p>In <i>Global Perspectives on Higher Education</i>, renowned higher education scholar Philip G. Altbach offers a wide-ranging perspective on the implications of these key forces and explores how they influence academe everywhere. Altbach begins with a discussion of the global trends that increasingly affect higher education, including the implications of mass enrollments, the logic of mass higher education systems around the world, and specific challenges facing Brazil, Russia, India, and China. He considers the numerous implications of globalization, including the worldwide use of the English language, university cross-border initiatives, the role of research universities in developing countries, the impact of the West on Asian universities, and the expansion of private higher education.</p><p>Provocative and wide-ranging, <i>Global Perspectives on Higher Education</i> considers how the international exchange of ideas, students, and scholars has fundamentally altered higher education.</p></p><p><p>The single best book on higher education as a global phenomenon.</p><p><b>Philip G.

Their vivid, tightly focused observations of the life of Dublin's poorer classes, their unconventional themes, coarse language, and mention of actual people and places made publishers of the day reluctant to undertake sponsorship.<br>Today, however, the stories are admired for their intense and masterly dissection of "dear dirty Dublin," and for the economy and grace with which Joyce invested this youthful fiction. From "The Sisters," the first story, illuminating a young boy's initial encounter with death, through the final piece, "The Dead," considered a masterpiece of the form, these tales represent, as Joyce himself explained, a chapter in the moral history of Ireland that would give the Irish "one good look at themselves." But in the end the stories are not just about the Irish; they represent moments of revelation common to all people.<br>Now readers can enjoy all 15 stories in this inexpensive collection, which also functions as an excellent, accessible introduction to the work of one of the 20th century's most influential writers. <i>Dubliners</i> is reprinted here, complete and unabridged, from a standard edition.</p></p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Jon Stewart's book will come as an extremely pleasant surprise. He eschews the standard standup patter and instead gives us 18 short comic essays in a variety of styles that recall the prose work of Woody Allen, only with a few more references to genitals. Stewart proves himself a remarkably nimble humorist with a sharp eye for parody, whether he's writing "A Very Hanson Christmas" or "Adolf Hitler: The Larry King Interview." <p> </p><blockquote> HITLER: ...Larry, look, I was a bad guy. No question. I hate that Hitler. The yelling, the finger pointing, I don't know ... I was a very angry guy.<p> KING: And this ... new Hitler?</p><p> HITLER: I get up at seven, have half a melon, do the jumble in the morning paper and then let the day take me where it will.... Me!!

When you stop having to control everything it's very freeing. </p></blockquote> <p> Stewart is not afraid to flirt with bad taste, in fact, some of the pieces in this collection do for "flirting with bad taste" what Bill Clinton did for "not having sexual relations." But it's wonderful to see an edgy comedian taking on the traditionally cozy genre of the humorous essay, creating work that combines the wit of Robert Benchley with the energy and attitude of the best modern standup. <i>Naked Pictures of Famous People</i> proves that Jon Stewart is as comfortable, and accomplished, in front of a word processor as he is in front of an audience. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>Jon Stewart has hosted his own critically acclaimed late-night talk show, starred in his own HBO special, <em> Unleavened,</em> and played himself on the cult hit <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em> Stewart lives in New York City.</p><h2>A Silent Fury: The El Bordo Mine Fire</h2><p><p>On March 10, 1920, in Pachuca, Mexico, the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company&#x2015;the largest employer in the region, and known simply as the Company&#x2015;may have been guilty of murder.</p><br><p>The alert was first raised at six in the morning: a fire was tearing through the El Bordo mine.

She lives in New York City.<b>The Gray Champion</b><br><br>There was once a time, when New-England groaned under the actual pressure of heavier wrongs, than those threatened ones which brought on the Revolution. James II., the bigoted successor of Charles the Voluptuous, had annulled the charters of all the colonies, and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion. The administration of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny: a Governor and Council, holding office from the King, and wholly independent of the coun- try; laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people, immediate or by their representatives; the rights of private citizens violated, and the titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press; and, finally, disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil. For two years, our ancestors were kept in sullen submission, by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother country, whether its head chanced to be a Parliament, Protector, or popish Monarch. Till these evil times, however, such allegiance had been merely nominal, and the colonists had ruled themselves, enjoying far more freedom, than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain.<br><br>At length, a rumor reached our shores, that the Prince of Orange had ventured on an enterprise, the success of which would be the triumph of civil and religious rights and the salvation of New-England. It was but a doubtful whisper; it might be false, or the attempt might fail; and, in either case, the man, that stirred against King James, would lose his head. Still the intelligence produced a marked effect. The people smiled mysteriously in the streets, and threw bold glances at their oppressors; while, far and wide, there was a subdued and silent agitation, as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from its sluggish despondency. Aware of their danger, the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing display of strength, and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsher measures. One afternoon in April, 1689, Sir Edmund Andros and his favorite councillors, being warm with wine, assembled the red-coats of the Governor&#x2019;s Guard, and made their appearance in the streets of Boston. The sun was near setting when the march commenced.<br><br>The roll of the drum, at that unquiet crisis, seemed to go through the streets, less as the martial music of the soldiers, than as a muster-call to the inhabitants themselves. A multitude, by various avenues, assembled in King-street, which was destined to be the scene, nearly a century afterwards, of another encounter between the troops of Britain, and a people struggling against her tyranny. Though more than sixty years had elapsed, since the Pilgrims came, this crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features of their character, perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions. There was the sober garb, the general severity of mien, the gloomy but undismayed expression, the scriptural forms of speech, and the confidence in Heaven&#x2019;s blessing on a righteous cause, which would have marked a band of the original Puritans, when threatened by some peril of the wilderness. Indeed, it was not yet time for the old spirit to be extinct; since there were men in the street, that day, who had worshipped there beneath the trees, before a house was reared to the God, for whom they had become exiles. Old soldiers of the Parliament were here too, smiling grimly at the thought, that their aged arms might strike another blow against the house of Stuart. Here also, were the veterans of King Philip&#x2019;s war9 who had burnt villages and slaughtered young and old, with pious fierceness, while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them with prayer. Several ministers were scattered among the crowd, which, unlike all other mobs, regarded them with such reverence, as if there were sanctity in their very garments. These holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people, but not to disperse them. Meantime, the purpose of the Governor, in disturbing the peace of the town, at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country into a ferment, was almost the universal subject of inquiry, and variously explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Satan will strike his master-stroke presently,&#x201d; cried some, &#x201c;because he knoweth that his time is short. All our godly pastors are to be dragged to prison! We shall see them at a Smithfield fire in King-street!&#x201d;<br><br>Hereupon, the people of each parish gathered closer round their minister, who looked calmly upwards and assumed a more apostolic dignity, as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his profession, the crown of martyrdom. It was actually fancied, at that period, that New-England might have a John Rogers of her own, to take the place of that worthy in the Primer.<br><br>&#x201c;The Pope of Rome has given orders for a new St. Bartholomew!&#x201d; cried others. &#x201c;We are to be massacred, man and male child!&#x201d;<br><br>Neither was this rumor wholly discredited, although the wiser class believed the Governor&#x2019;s object somewhat less atrocious. His predecessor under the old charter, Bradstreet, a venerable companion of the first settlers, was known to be in town. There were grounds for conjecturing, that Sir Edmund Andros intended, at once, to strike terror, by a parade of military force, and to confound the opposite faction, by possessing himself of their chief.<br><br>&#x201c;Stand firm for the old charter Governor!&#x201d; shouted the crowd, seizing upon the idea. &#x201c;The good old Governor Bradstreet!&#x201d;<br><br>While this cry was at the loudest, the people were surprised by the well known figure of Governor Bradstreet himself, a patriarch of nearly ninety, who appeared on the elevated steps of a door, and, with characteristic mildness, besought them to submit to the constituted authorities.<br><br>&#x201c;My children,&#x201d; concluded this venerable person, &#x201c;do nothing rashly. Cry not aloud, but pray for the welfare of New-England, and expect patiently what the Lord will do in this matter!&#x201d;<br><br>The event was soon to be decided. All this time, the roll of the drum had been approaching through Cornhill, louder and deeper, till, with reverberations from house to house, and the regular tramp of martial footsteps, it burst into the street. A double rank of soldiers made their appearance, occupying the whole breadth of the passage, with shouldered matchlocks, and matches burning, so as to present a row of fires in the dusk. Their steady march was like the progress of a machine, that would roll irresistibly over every thing in its way. Next, moving slowly, with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement, rode a party of mounted gentlemen, the central figure being Sir Edmund Andros, elderly, but erect and soldier-like. Those around him were his favorite councillors, and the bitterest foes of New-England. At his right hand rode Edward Randolph, our arch enemy, that &#x201c;blasted wretch,&#x201d; as Cotton Mathee calls him, who achieved the downfall of our ancient government, and was followed with a sensible curse, through life and to his grave. On the other side was Bullivant, scattering jests and mockery as he rode along. Dudley came behind, with a downcast look, dreading, as well he might, to meet the indignant gaze of the people, who beheld him, their only countryman by birth, among the oppressors of his native land. The captain of a frigate in the harbor, and two or three civil officers under the Crown, were also there. But the figure which most attracted the public eye, and stirred up the deepest feeling, was the Episcopal clergyman of King&#x2019;s Chapel, riding haughtily among the magistrates in his priestly vestments, the fitting representative of prelacy and persecution, the union of church and state, and all those abominations which had driven the Puritans to the wilderness. Another guard of soldiers, in double rank, brought up the rear.</p><h2>The Cold War: A History</h2><p><p><b>"The history of the Cold War has been the history of the world since 1954." </b></p><p>So begins <i>The Cold War: A History</i>, a wide-ranging narrative by award-winning political commentator Martin Walker, which was one of the first major studies of its kind.

Is it possible for a person to be a Christian without true repentance?</p><p>For the answers to such thought-provoking questions, Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones turns readers to Psalm 51, which is perhaps <strong>the</strong> classic statement on repentance in all of Scripture. It not only models the process involved in receiving salvation and forgiveness for sins--from the Holy Spirit's conviction and the sinner's confession to God's cleansing and renewal--but draws a profile of the truly repentant heart.</p><p>"<em>There are certain things that we must realize, we must grasp, we must believe [before salvation can be ours], and the first of these is repentance.... Without repentance there is no knowledge of salvation, there is no experience of salvation. It is an essential step. It is the first step.</em>"</p><p>This moving study gives readers a fuller understanding of the importance of repentance both for the unsaved and for Christians. Enlightening and practical, <em>Out of the Depths</em> is necessary reading for the earnest seeker who wants to take that first step on the road to salvation, and for the troubled Christian desiring to find again the path to a restore relationship with God.</p></p><p><p><strong>Martyn Lloyd-Jones</strong> (1899&#x2013;1981), minister of Westminster Chapel in London for&nbsp;thirty years, was one of the foremost preachers of his day.

They stressed that man realizes his true existence in the measure in which he is raised up toward God and united with Him. In the foreword to this study, Bishop Kallistos (Ware) reflects on how difficult it is today, because of our modern understanding of the human person, to find the right words to express the subtle but significant ways that Christian writers of the past saw this mysterious, often indefinable character of the human person. </p><p>According to Bishop Kallistos, "few if any works have opened up for me more lines of inquiry than Deification in Christ" and few have helped me better to appreciate the Patristic approach" to the nature and destiny of man. </p><p>In this extraordinary study, Panayiotis Nellas examines certain central themes of patristic anthropology synthetically, throughout the whole range of patristic anthropology synthetically, throughout the whole range of patristic literature. He then treats the same themes in a single father and in a service from the Orthodox liturgy. Finally, he cites a number of patristic passages at length and provides references and notes which incorporate the findings of modern scholarship. This approach not only provides an excellent introduction to patristic anthropology, but also clearly demonstrates the internal consistency and coherence of the Orthodox understanding of man and his relation to God and the world. <br> <br> <i>Deification in Christ</i> is part of the CONTEMPORARY GREEK THEOLOGIANS SERIES.</p></p><p>Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Aunt Dimity and the Next of Kin (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p><b>Hidden among her belongings are clues that Lori feels certain Miss Beacham wished to be discovered after her death.&nbsp;Watch out for Nancy Atherton's latest,&nbsp;<i><b>Aunt Dimity and the King's Ransom</b></i>, coming in&nbsp;July 2018&nbsp;from Viking!</b><br><br>Feeling a touch world-weary, Lori Shepherd decides to become a volunteer at the Radcliffe Infirmary, where she meets Elizabeth Beacham, a kind, retired legal secretary.

The root of these stories is the experience of hope found in the birth of Jesus and the affirmations of surrender and service embodied in his parents, Joseph and Mary. <br><br>This is a story of longing and seeking, as demonstrated by the Magi searching for the redemption offered by the birth of a new king. It is a story of sacrifice and trusting completely in the wisdom of God as seen in the faith of Simeon, the just and devout man of Jerusalem, when he is in the presence of the Christ child. Ultimately, Jesus&#x2019; life and message is a story for today, one that speaks to the restlessness of the human heart searching for the sole truth which alone leads to profound joy.</p><p><b>JOSEPH RATZINGER, Pope Benedict XVI,</b> born in 1927 in Germany, was head of the Roman Catholic Church from 2005 to 2013. A prolific author, theologian and university professor,&nbsp;Ratzinger served as an "expert" at the Second Vatican Council, and was tapped in 1977 by Pope Paul VI to lead the German Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. In 1981, Pope John Paul II called him to Rome to head the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, where he served until his papal election.Chapter 1 <br><br> <i>"Where Are You From?" </i>(John 19:9) <br><br> <b>The question about Jesus' origin as a question about being and mission </b><br><br> While he was interrogating Jesus, Pilate unexpectedly put this question to the accused: "Where are you from?" Jesus' accusers had called for him to receive the death penalty by dramatically declaring that this Jesus had made himself the Son of God-a capital offense under the law. The "enlight�ened" Roman judge, who had already expressed skepticism regarding the question of truth (cf. <i>Jn </i>18:38), could easily have found this claim by the accused laughable. And yet he was frightened. The accused had indicated that he was a king, but that his kingdom was "not of this world" ( <i>Jn </i>18:36). And then he had alluded to a mysterious origin and purpose, say�ing: "For this I was born and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth" ( <i>Jn </i>18:37). <br><br> All this must have seemed like madness to the Roman judge. And yet he could not shake off the mysterious impres�sion left by this man, so different from those he had met before who resisted Roman domination and fought for the restoration of the kingdom of Israel. The Roman judge asks where Jesus is from in order to understand who he really is and what he wants. <br><br> The question about Jesus' provenance, as an inquiry after his deeper origin and hence his true being, is also found in other key passages of Saint John's Gospel, and it plays an equally important role in the Synoptic Gospels. For John, as for the Synoptics, it raises a singular paradox. On the one hand, counting against Jesus and his claim to a divine mission, is the fact that people knew exactly where he was from: he does not come from heaven, from "the Father," from "above," as he purports to ( <i>Jn </i>8:23). No: "Is not this Jesus, whose fa�ther and mother we know? How does he now say, 'I have come down from heaven'?" ( <i>Jn </i>6:42). <br><br> The Synoptics tell of a similar dispute that arose in the synagogue at Nazareth, Jesus' hometown. Jesus had ex�pounded the words of sacred Scripture not in the customary manner, but by relating them to himself and his mission with an authority that went beyond the bounds of all exege�sis (cf. <i>Lk </i>4:21). The listeners were understandably shocked by this treatment of Scripture, by the claim that he himself was the inner point of reference and the key to exegesis of the sacred text. Shock led to denial: " 'Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?' And they took offense at him" (<i>Mk </i>6:3). <br><br> They know perfectly well who Jesus is and where he comes from-he is one among others. He is one like us. His claim can only be presumption. Moreover, Nazareth was not associated with any such promise. John recounts that Philip said to Nathanael: "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." Nathanael's response is well known: "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" ( <i>Jn </i>1:45f.). The or�dinariness of Jesus, the provincial carpenter, seems not to conceal a mystery of any kind. His origin marks him out as one like any other. <br><br> Yet the reverse argument is also adduced against Jesus' au�thority, as in the dispute with the man born blind, after he received his sight: "We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man [Jesus], we do not know where he comes from" ( <i>Jn </i>9:29). <br><br> When Jesus preached in their synagogue, the people of Nazareth had said something rather similar, before dismiss�ing him as someone well-known to them and just like them: "Where did this man get all this? What is the wisdom given to him? What mighty works are wrought by his hands!" <br><br> (<i>Mk </i>6:2). Here too the question "where is he from?" arises- only to be dismissed straight away by the reference to his relatives. <br><br> Jesus' provenance is both known and unknown, seem�ingly easy to establish, and yet not exhaustively. In Caesarea Philippi, Jesus will ask his disciples: "Who do people say that I am? . . . Who do you say that I am?" (<i>Mk </i>8:27ff.). Who is Jesus? Where is he from? The two questions are inseparably linked. <br><br> The four Gospels set out to answer these questions. They were written in order to supply an answer. Matthew opens his Gospel with Jesus' genealogy because he wants to put the question of Jesus' provenance in the correct light from the very beginning: the genealogy serves as a kind of heading to the entire Gospel. Luke, on the other hand, places Jesus' genealogy at the beginning of his public ministry, as a kind of public presentation of Jesus, in order to answer the same question with a different emphasis-in anticipation of all that is about to unfold in the rest of the Gospel. Let us now try to understand more closely the essential purpose of the two genealogies. <br><br> For Matthew, two names are of key significance if we are to understand Jesus' provenance: Abraham and David. <br><br> The story of the promise begins with Abraham, fol�lowing the dispersal of mankind after the building of the Tower of Babel. Abraham points ahead to what is yet to come. He is a wayfarer, not only from the land of his birth into the promised land, but also on the journey from the present into the future. His whole life points forward, it is a dynamic of walking along the path of what is to come. Thus the Letter to the Hebrews rightly presents him as a pilgrim of faith on the basis of the promise: "He looked forward to the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (11:10). For Abraham, the promise refers in the first instance to his descendants, but it also extends further: "all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by him" (<i>Gen </i>18:18). Thus the whole history, beginning with Abraham and leading to Jesus, is open toward universality- through Abraham, blessing comes to all. <br><br> From the beginning of the genealogy, then, the focus is already on the end of the Gospel, when the risen Lord says to the disciples: "Make disciples of all nations" (<i>Mt </i>28:19). In the particular history revealed by the genealogy, this move�ment toward the whole is present from the beginning: the universality of Jesus' mission is already contained within his origin. <br><br> Both the genealogy and the history that it recounts are largely structured around the figure of David, the king to whom the promise of an eternal kingdom had been given: "Your throne shall be established for ever" (2<i> Sam </i>7:16). The genealogy that Matthew puts before us is steeped in this promise. It is constructed in three sets of fourteen genera�tions, at first rising from Abraham to David, then descending from Solomon to the Babylonian captivity, and then rising again to Jesus, in whom the promise comes to fulfillment. The king who is to last for ever now appears-looking quite different, though, from what the Davidic model might have led one to expect. <br><br> This threefold division becomes even clearer if we bear in mind that the Hebrew letters of the name "David" add up to fourteen: even in terms of number symbolism, then, the path from Abraham to Jesus bears the clear imprint of David, his name and his promise. On this basis one could say that the genealogy, with its three sets of fourteen gen�erations, is truly a Gospel of Christ the King: the whole of history looks toward him whose throne is to endure for ever. <br><br> Matthew's genealogy traces the male line, but in the course of it, prior to Mary who appears at the end, four women are mentioned by name: Tamar, Rahab, Ruth and the wife of Uriah. Why do these women appear in the genealogy? By what criterion are they chosen? <br><br> It has been said that all four women were sinners. So their inclusion here would serve to indicate that Jesus took upon himself their sins-and with them the sins of the world-and that his mission was the justification of sinners. <br><br> But this cannot have been the determining factor for the selection, not least because it does not in fact apply to all four women. More important, none of these women were Jewish. So through them the world of the Gentiles enters the genealogy of Jesus-his mission to Jews <i>and</i> Gentiles is made manifest. <br><br> Yet most important of all is the fact that the genealogy ends with a woman: Mary, who truly marks a new begin�ning and relativizes the entire genealogy. Throughout the generations, we find the formula: "Abraham was the father of Isaac . . ." But at the end, there is something quite different. In Jesus' case there is no reference to fatherhood, instead we read: "Jacob [was] the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ" (<i>Mt </i>1:16). In the account of Jesus' birth that follows immediately after�ward, Matthew tells us that Joseph was not Jesus' father and that he wanted to dismiss Mary on account of her supposed adultery. But this is what is said to him: "That which is con�ceived in Mary is of the Holy Spirit" (<i>Mt </i>1:20). So the final sentence turns the whole genealogy around. Mary is a new beginning. Her child does not originate from any man, but is a new creation, conceived through the Holy Spirit. <br><br> The genealogy is still important: Joseph is the legal fa�ther of Jesus. Through him, Jesus belongs by law, "legally," to the house of David. And yet he comes from elsewhere, "from above"-from God himself. The mystery of his prov�enance, his dual origin, confronts us quite concretely: his origin can be named and yet it is a mystery. Only God is truly his "father." The human genealogy has a certain sig�nificance in terms of world history. And yet in the end it is Mary, the lowly virgin from Nazareth, in whom a new be�ginning takes place, in whom human existence starts afresh. <br><br> Let us take a look now at the genealogy found in Luke's Gospel (cf. 3:23-38). Several differences strike us vis-�-vis the list of ancestors supplied by Saint Matthew. <br><br> We have already established that this genealogy intro�duces the public ministry, it so to speak legitimizes Jesus in his public mission, whereas Matthew presents the genealogy as the very start of the Gospel, proceeding from there to the account of Jesus' conception and birth, and thus unfolding the question of his provenance in its dual significance. <br><br> A further striking difference is that Matthew and Luke agree on only a handful of names; not even the name of Jo�seph's father is common to the two. How can this be? Apart from elements drawn from the Old Testament, both authors have based themselves on traditions whose sources we cannot reconstruct. It seems to me utterly futile to formulate hy�potheses on this matter. Neither evangelist is concerned so much with the individual names as with the symbolic struc�ture within which Jesus' place in history is set before us: the intricacy with which he is woven into the historical strands of the promise, as well as the <i>new beginning</i> which paradoxi�cally characterizes his origin side by side with the <i>continuity</i> of God's action in history. <br><br> A further difference consists in the fact that whereas Matthew climbs from the beginnings-from the root-to the present, to the top of the "tree," Luke on the contrary descends from Jesus, the "treetop," down to the roots, in order to show that in the end the ultimate root is found not in the depths but rather in the "heights"-God is there at the beginning of human existence: "Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God" (<i>Lk </i>3:38). <br><br> An element common to Matthew and Luke is that the genealogy breaks off and comes to a stop when it reaches Joseph: "Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph" (<i>Lk </i>3:23). Legally he was considered Joseph's son, as Luke tells us. Yet Jesus' true origin had already been made clear in the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. <br><br> Whereas Matthew gives a clear and theologically symbolic structure to his genealogy, with its three sets of fourteen names, Luke arranges his 76 names without any outwardly recognizable pattern. Yet here too a symbolic structuring of historical time can be detected: the genealogy contains eleven times seven members. Luke may have known the apocalyptic formula that divides world history into twelve parts and at the end consists of eleven times seven generations. So this could be a discreet way of indicating that with Jesus "the fullness of time" had come, that with him the decisive hour of world history had dawned: he is the new Adam, who once again comes "from God"-but in a more radical way than the first Adam, not merely breathed into being by God, but truly God's "Son." While for Matthew it is the Davidic promise that permeates the symbolic structuring of time, Luke, in tracing the line back to Adam, wants to show that humanity starts afresh in Jesus. The genealogy expresses a promise that concerns the whole of humanity. <br><br> In this connection, another reading of Luke's geneal�ogy is worth mentioning, one that we find in the writings of Saint Irenaeus. The text he was using had not 76 but 72 names. 72 (or 70) was the number, derived from <i>Ex </i>1:5, that indicated the number of people in the world-a figure that appears in the Lucan tradition of 72 (or 70) disciples, whom Jesus set alongside the twelve Apostles. Irenaeus writes as follows: "To prove this, Luke shows that the genealogy of our Lord, which extends to Adam, contains seventy-two generations, and so he joins the end to the beginning and points out that it is he [Christ] who recapitulates in himself all the nations that had been dispersed from Adam onward, and all the tongues, and the human race, including Adam himself. Hence Paul, too, styled Adam a type of the one who was to come" (<i>Adv. Haer.</i> III, 22,3). <br><br> Even if the authentic Lucan text does not contain at this point the symbolism of the 70, on which Saint Irenaeus' exegesis depends, nevertheless the underlying intention of Luke's genealogy is correctly grasped here. Jesus takes upon himself the whole of humanity, the whole history of man, and he gives it a decisive re-orientation toward a new manner of human existence. <br><br> John the evangelist, who repeatedly raises the question of Jesus' provenance, does not present a genealogy at the begin�ning of his Gospel, but in the Prologue he grandly and em�phatically proposes an answer to that question. At the same time he expands his answer to the question into a definition of Christian life: on the basis of Jesus' provenance he sheds light upon the identity of his followers. <br><br> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God . . . and the Word became flesh and dwelt [pitched his tent] among us" ( <i>Jn </i>1:1-14). The man Jesus is the dwelling-place of the Word, the eternal di�vine Word, in this world. Jesus' "flesh," his human existence, is the "dwelling" or "tent" of the Word: the reference to the sacred tent of Israel in the wilderness is unmistakable. Jesus is, so to speak, the tent of meeting-he is the reality for which the tent and the later Temple could only serve as signs. Jesus' origin, his provenance, is the true "beginning"-the primordial source from which all things come, the "light" that makes the world into the cosmos. He comes from God. He is God. This "beginning" that has come to us opens up-as a beginning-a new manner of human existence. "For to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God" ( <i>Jn </i>1:12f.). <br><br> One version of the manuscript tradition preserves a reading of this sentence no...</p><h2>Why You Lose at Bridge</h2><p>Reprint of the classic.

That&#x2019;s where the king&#x2019;s Court was staying. &#x201c;Are we under arrest?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man tapped his foot impatiently. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that was how Tom and I ended up bumping our way through the countryside in the back of this carriage. After a night under guard in an inn, Tom was convinced we were headed for doom.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to end up in the dungeon,&#x201d; he moaned.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to end up in the dungeon,&#x201d; I said, not entirely certain of that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know what happens in a dungeon? There&#x2019;s no food. They starve you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not even in irons.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom&#x2019;s lower lip trembled. &#x201c;All you get is a single piece of bread, once a night. And not the good bread, either, with poppy seeds and maybe a bit of cinnamon. No. It&#x2019;s hard bread. Hard bread for a hard life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Trust the baker&#x2019;s son to critique the dungeon&#x2019;s bread. Still, I wished he&#x2019;d stop. The more he spoke, the more the prospect of wasting away behind bars loomed large in my mind. I tried to push his worry aside and think of why Lord Ashcombe would call for us.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d only had contact with the King&#x2019;s Warden twice since we&#x2019;d stopped the plot against the city at the height of the plague. The first was after Magistrate Aldebourne had told Lord Ashcombe what had happened. He&#x2019;d written to me separately, asking for my account. The second was when he&#x2019;d found a job for Sally, as promised.<br> <br>His note, characteristically brief, said he&#x2019;d found her a position as chambermaid to the Lady Pemberton, and a horse would come to collect her. As the baroness was with Court, which had fled London when the plague came, Sally had said a bittersweet goodbye to us back in September. Since she&#x2019;d gone, I&#x2019;d written her letters every week, but I hadn&#x2019;t heard back. That wasn&#x2019;t unexpected&#x2014;her job wouldn&#x2019;t give her enough money to pay for post&#x2014;but Lord Ashcombe&#x2019;s summons made me wonder if she was in some kind of trouble.<br> <br>The carriage slowed. Tom and I watched from the window as we turned north, off the road to Oxford. It appeared the city wouldn&#x2019;t be our destination after all. We skirted the town, lumbering through deep ruts in the mud, until our driver pulled us onto the grounds of a private estate.<br> <br>Oaks lined the pathway, autumn-copper leaves stained rusty orange by the torches staked between them. Our horses, their breath puffing wispy clouds in the November chill, dragged us up the road to the mansion atop the slope. Lamps glowed through the windows, adding their light to the haze in the frosty air.<br> <br>This place was no prison. And, whatever reason we were here, we wouldn&#x2019;t be alone. Dozens of other carriages lined the lawn, flattening the grass under mud-caked wheels, while their drivers lounged about, waiting.<br> <br>Our own transport pulled to a stop in front of the mansion, where a man in livery ushered us from the coach. The King&#x2019;s Men nudged us up the stairs, through a set of grand double doors. A coat of arms was carved into the stone above the entrance: crossed halberds over a shield emblazoned with antlers.<br> <br>Wherever we were, this place was astounding. The entrance hall alone was as big as my entire house. A marble staircase curved upward from the center of the foyer to the upper floors. A pair of servants waited there, their livery matching the staff standing by the half dozen exits to the different wings of the estate. From somewhere beyond, I heard the sounds of a gathering and the faint strains of music.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lord Ashcombe strode into the entryway, dressed in fine black silks. He wore a patch over his left eye and a glove on his three-fingered right hand, wounds from a battle with the men who&#x2019;d murdered my master earlier this year. There was no sword at his side, but his pearl-handled pistol was jammed into his belt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, General,&#x201d; the King&#x2019;s Man accompanying us said. &#x201c;The rain&#x2019;s turned the roads to slop.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lord Ashcombe grunted and looked us over. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need to get you ready.&#x201d; He motioned to the servants on the stairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;My lord?&#x201d; I glanced at Tom, who, by this point, was close to fainting. &#x201c;Are we in trouble?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lord Ashcombe raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Should you be?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I suppose it&#x2019;ll depend on how this evening goes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This evening?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Lord Ashcombe said. &#x201c;The king wants to speak with you.&#x201d;</p><h2>Organic No-Till Farming</h2><p>Organic No-Till Farming offers a map to an organic farming system that limits tillage, reduces labor, and improves soil structure.

Jonathan Wilson has travelled extensively behind the old Iron Curtain, viewing life beyond the fall of the Berlin Wall through the lens of football. </p><p>Where once the state-controlled teams of the Eastern bloc passed their way with crisp efficiency - a sort of communist version of total football - to considerable success on the European and international stages, today the beautiful game in the East has been opened up to the free market, and throughout the region a sense of chaos pervades. The threat of totalitarian interference no longer remains; but in its place mafia control is generally accompanied with a crippling lack of funds. </p><p>In BEHIND THE CURTAIN Jonathan Wilson goes in search of the spirit of Hungary's 'Golden Squad' of the early fifties, charts the disintegration of the footballing superpower that was the former Yugoslavia, follows a sorry tale of corruption, mismanagement and Armenian cognac through the Caucasuses, reopens the case of Russia's greatest footballer, Eduard Streltsov, and talks to Jan Tomaszewski about an autumn night at Wembley in 1973...</p></p><p>Jonathan Wilson is the football correspondent for the FINANCIAL TIMES, and writes for the SUNDAY TELEGRAPH and GUARDIAN ONLINE.

This book answers those questions.<br><br><i>Preaching in Hitler's Shadow</i> begins with a fascinating look at Christian life inside the Third Reich, giving readers a real sense of the danger that pastors faced every time they went into the pulpit.

Searching for a Language of Life in Faith and Politics<br> "After his thorough and superb presentation of the historical context, Dean Stroud provides captivating examples of biblical preaching and prophetic witness by pastors of the Confessing Church in Nazi Germany. He leaves no doubt about the life-threatening crisis the Nazis presented to Germany and the church. Neither is there any doubt about the response of the prophets here brought to life. One is simply stunned by the courage of prophetic faithfulness and by the sheer power of the Word preached in persistent obedience and at enormous risk. Here are voices that cannot be stilled. . . . Preaching in Hitler's Shadow is simply a towering book.

Workers by the tens of thousands headed north, hoping to make their fortunes working on the pipeline, in a stampede that dramatically affected Alaska. With the avalanche of big money and new arrivals came new problems: drugs, prostitution, gambling, and violent crime.

But this book argues that the games black girls play &#x2014;handclapping songs, cheers, and double-dutch jump rope&#x2014;both reflect and inspire the principles of black popular musicmaking.</p><p><b>The Games Black Girls Play</b> illustrates how black musical styles are incorporated into the earliest games African American girls learn&#x2014;how, in effect, these games contain the DNA of black music. Drawing on interviews, recordings of handclapping games and cheers, and her own observation and memories of gameplaying, Kyra D. Gaunt argues that black girls' games are connected to long traditions of African and African American musicmaking, and that they teach vital musical and social lessons that are carried into adulthood. In this celebration of playground poetry and childhood choreography, she uncovers the surprisingly rich contributions of girls&#x2019; play to black popular culture.</p></p><p><p><b>Kyra D.

Gaunt successfully lifts ignored girls from obscurity to center stage. . . . With <i>The Games Black Girls Play</i>, Gaunt has created a necessary space for translating black girls&#x2019; joy in a society that typically overlooks it. Hopefully, others will take their turn and jump in to keep the games going.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Bitch</i> </p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>The Games Black Girls Play</i> is beautifully and passionately written. This book presents an engaging reflexive narrative that ranges from childhood memories to involvement with ethnomusicological scholarship. Gaunt makes a convincing argument that the playsongs of African American girls is the foundation of African diasporic popular music-making. In a radical counter-history, she shows how African American girls-interlocutors who are triply minoritized through race, gender, and age-are producing music culture that has profound influences on popular music and the popular imagination. She calls for an engaged ethnomusicology and moves gracefully through an array of anti-essentialist perspectives on race and gender. She argues that &#x201c;kinetic orality&#x2019; is key to African American musicking and that the body is always a locus of memory and communality. From somatic historiography to serious cross-talk with girls, Gaunt offers new methodologies for ethnomusicological work. The reader is pulled into a world in which Black girls are masters of musical knowledge, and in emerging from the book, we can't see the world of American popular music in the same way. When we chant Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack is dressed in black, black, black, with silver buttons, buttons, buttons, all down her back, back, back, we suddenly see how musical play and embodied knowledge generates a world of raced and gendered sociality. Oo-lay oo-lay! Congratulations, Kyra!&#x201d;<br>-President Elect Professor Deborah Wong,Society for Ethnomusicology</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In thoughtful and affectionate prose, Gaunt makes plain how the schoolyard syncopations of body and voice are both oral-kinetic play and improvised lessons in socializing girls into the unique social practices of black urban life. . . . <i>The Games Black Girls Play</i> is a smart, delightful and witty polemic of attributions; a cultural benchmark of the complex web of history, race and gender to suggest a &#x2018;gendered musical blackness&#x2019; and an &#x2018;ethnographic truth&#x2019; linking the &#x2018;intergenerational cultures of black musical expression&#x2019; as embodied in the infectious playfulness of black girls.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Black Issues Book Review</i></p></p><h2>The World Is Made of Stories</h2><p>In this dynamic and utterly novel presentation, David Loy explores the fascinating proposition that the stories we tell--about what is and is not possible, about ourselves, about right and wrong, life and death, about the world and everything in it--become the very building blocks of our experience and of reality itself. Loy uses an intriguing mixture of quotations from familiar and less-familiar sources and brief stand-alone micro-essays, engaging the reader in challenging and illuminating dialogue. As we come to see that the world is made--in a word--of stories, we come to a richer understanding of that most elusive of Buddhist ideas: shunyata, the &#34;generative emptiness&#34; that is the all-pervading quality inherent to all mental and physical forms in our ever-changing world. Reminiscent of Zen koans and works of sophisticated poetry, this book will reward both a casual read and deep reflection.</p><p>David R.

Author: Stephen Batchelor, author of Confession of a Buddhist Atheist<br><br>"In this slender but powerful book Loy draws the reader's attention to the power of words. He shows how stories have spoken us into existence, how each of us story the world into existence, and how these different stories inform and transform themselves, each other, and us. I consider Loy one of the most important spiritual thinkers of our day."

Author: Kurt Spellmeyer, author of Buddha at the Apocalypse</p><h2>Perspectives Old and New on Paul: The &#34;Lutheran&#34; Paul and His Critics</h2><p>Here, finally, is a much-needed review and analysis of the divergent interpretations of Paul. With a clear head and winsome sense of humor, Stephen Westerholm compares the traditional understanding of Paul to more recent readings, drawing on the writings of key figures in the debate both past and present. Westerholm first offers a detailed portrait of the &#34;Lutheran&#34; Paul, including the way such theologians as Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Wesley have traditionally interpreted &#34;justification by faith&#34; to mean that God declares sinners &#34;righteous&#34; by his grace apart from &#34;works.&#34; Westerholm then explores how Paul has fared in the twentieth century, in which &#34;New Perspective&#34; readings of Paul see him teaching that Gentiles need not become Jews or observe Jewish law to be God&#39;s people. The final section of the book looks anew at disputed areas of Paul&#39;s theological language and offers compelling discussion on the place of both justification by faith and Mosaic law in divine redemption.</p><p>Professor of biblical studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.<b><i>The Bible Today</i></b><br>"A thorough and very illuminating study of Pauline interpretation, with particular emphasis on the longstanding debate over whether the Pauline teaching on justification through faith alone should stand at the heart of Pauline theology."<br><br><b><i>Choice</i></b><br>"Wit and humor make this weighty volume an excellent source for the novice and for the seasoned scholar. Recommended."<br><br><b>Thomas R. Schreiner</b><br>"Stephen Westerholm's book is the ideal entr?e into the discussion on Paul, the law, and justification. Only here will readers find both contemporary and historic contributions to the debate explained. Westerholm reminds us that Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Wesley must be reckoned with seriously as profound interpreters of Paul. He also provides his own incisive and insightful contribution to the biblical text, repristinating the perspective of Luther for our day. Throughout, Westerholm writes with the sparkling clarity and wit that is characteristic of all his work."<br><br><b>John Barclay</b><br>"This eagerly awaited volume is a gem. After years of debate about the 'new perspective,' a debate bogged down with multiple confusions, Stephen Westerholm describes and analyzes all the main viewpoints on Paul's theology of law, grace, and justification from Augustine onward. With enviable clarity, incisive observation, and shafts of humor, Westerholm reaffirms and refines the 'old perspective' while also incorporating the strong points of the new. This is the book we all have needed, both scholars and students. It will surely help us escape the impasse in our current debates."<br><br><b>Bruce W. Longenecker</b><br>"Since its publication in 1988, Stephen Westerholm's book Israel's Law and the Church's Faith has served as one of the best explorations of Paul's view of justification by faith. That book is now superseded by Perspectives Old and New on Paul. Westerholm here elongates the temporal parameters of his earlier work, reconstructing the views of Paul's most significant interpreters from the distant past to the turn of the twenty-first century. Against the backdrop of his fair and principled survey of scholarship, Westerholm's own examination of Paul's texts is characterized by a depth of analytical and theological perception rarely found in scholarly studies. For those with time to read only one book about Paul's view of justification by faith, this should be the book. And for those with time to read more, this is the book to start with."<br><br><b>Simon J. Gathercole</b><br>"Written with sparkling humor, this book is a landmark work both in its treatment of the vast scholarly literature and in its crisp exegesis of Paul himself. Perspectives Old and New on Paul is proof again, if proof were needed, that Stephen Westerholm is still head and shoulders above almost everyone else as an interpreter of Paul."<br><br><b>Frank Thielman</b><br>"Stephen Westerholm's most recent missive from the battlefield of Pauline studies will enliven the most dazed student and cheer the crustiest scholar.

There, Kirilow meets Kora, a girl-woman desperate to save her family from the epidemic. Kora has everything Kirilow is looking for, except the will to abandon her own family.

Auntie Radix already took Peristrophe Halliana's liver a week ago, and one of her kidneys the month before that. Auntie Radix says that it is the duty and nature of a starfish to give. I tell her it is the duty and nature of a doubler to know when to stop asking. Peristrophe Halliana and I have seen the season of rain and flood only nineteen times each. We are barely old enough to do what we do. Auntie Radix has been drenched by the new monsoons forty-eight times. It should be her job to sacrifice for us, and not the other way round. It's a good thing that memory is not a part of the body that can be cut out, or no doubt she would ask for Peristrophe Halliana's memory too. <br> I bite back my reluctance. Radix Bupleuri is our queen, not to mention the eldest of the eighty-three sisters who live at Grist Village, and a direct descendent of Grandma Sarah Woo. We Grist sisters would not survive without her, so we owe her our absolute respect and indulgence. <br> I sigh. I clean, then sharpen my knives on my precious whetstone. Don't you know that diamonds are a girl's best friend? We made the whetstone ourselves, crushed so many engagement rings from skeletons of the time before, six glass towers full of nice ladies, sweet so sweet. Purty, the scavenger Aunties tell me, purty as cover girl, wonderful wonder bra, guess? by georges marciano. Purty as korean BB cream, purty as chanel #5, purty as I'm worth it, are you? <br> Purty and thin as skin and bones. They had time to work off the weight. Time to rot, time to mummify. For every season there is a reason. Off their skinny dead fingers the scavenger Aunties took their diamonds. Crushed those doggies to a coarse salt and made me my whetstone. Now I smooth my blade, one, two, three. All that love from the time before rushes into my shiv. <br> That's the way the cookie crumbles, I tell my beloved Peristrophe Halliana, as I work my knives. Once they are good and sharp, I wipe them down with mother moonshine. We make it ourselves in clawfoot tubs from the time before. With potatoes cropped from our own fields, you know, Mistress Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow? We pretty maids, we Sister Grist, some call us sock puppets, fuck puppets, matchstick monkeys. Who cares? We will outlive them all, in beds of our own making. <br> As I prepare my knives, I rant the chant the grannies gave me, the one that Grandma Sarah heard from the dirt, so long ago. My mother double Glorybind Groundsel, smoking medicinal marijuana in the old rosewood pipe she inherited from Grandma Sarah herself, chants with me, to make sure I get the words right. She teaches me my genealogy. You know, like, where we came from. What we are here for, all that. She teaches me how to be a good groom to my beloved Peristrophe Halliana, the last starfish among us, the last giver. It isn't easy you know-- to have and to hold, to kiss and to cut. Slit sluts, that's what they call us in Salt Water City. I'm not ignorant, I know what they say. It's why they expelled our grannies eighty years ago. For having and holding. For slicing and stitching. What did they expect from us anyhow? That they could keep making us again and again and again and again? Bust us from their greasy bottles like so many cheap gene genies? As if. Grandma Sarah invented the partho pop, you know, how we egg ourselves along, I mean, the long long love of the Grist Sisters. We split, we slit, we heal, we groom. Grandma Sarah invented the kiss cut, the repair job, what do you say, the fix, the patch. The first starfish gave her liver, her kidneys and at last her red hot heart to the first doubler. And so it was in the beginning. <br> I chant loud as I can to push down the dread that roils in my belly: <br> Our mother of milk and mildew<br> Our mother of dirt<br> Our mother of songs and sighing<br> Our mother of elk<br> Blessed are the sheep<br> And blessed are the roses<br> Blessed are the tigers <br> Wind, bones and onion flowers<br> We remember you and we remember rain<br> We remember mushrooms holding the globe in their mycorrhizal net<br> We remember dust<br> We remember meat<br> We remember fibre in its weave and fibre in its weft<br> The shifting and wobbling of the intentional earth<br> <br> After the Sister exodus from Salt Water City, Grandma Sarah herself doctored it all. She-- not only the first doubler but also the first groom, inventor of the loving transplant, the sexy suture. It feels good, you know, don't doubt it. We mutated the first forget-me-do, not that Isabelle Chow, not those salt water bitches who claim it for their upload and their down. Forget-me-do makes you feel pain as pleasure, leaves nothing but a craving to have the experience again. We cultivated it for the the sisterly insertion, the parthenogenic return, so many ways for one to become two. You heard me, you know what I mean. Wink wink. I'll do it now. I'll show you.<br> Peristrophe Halliana sips six slugs, infused with forget-me-do. I wipe down the last blade with a seventh. Then the flame, hot so hot. My precious bunsen burner salvaged from the very lab where Grandma Sarah was made, in old Salt Water town, the ruin that somehow keeps on being a city. All railway tracks, moldy stucco and tarnished glass skyscrapers. All rain, mud, bed bugs and rodentia. Rock-a-bye baby, in the cradle of civilization. <br> Thinking about it makes me will my knives super clean. Pour more vodka in to burn baby burn. I'm being followed by a moonshine shadow. Peristrophe Halliana is prone to infection. The cutting might be no big deal, but healing's a bummer. So knives must shimmer clean, a lean mean clean. I mean sparkle, twinkle like the lemon muscle man from the time before. Clean as Mister. Even though the mistresses are master here. <br> The first cut is the deepest. At the corner of the eye, at the zygomatic process. where the top of the skull attaches to the side of the head. I know my bones, my mother double Glorybind Groundsel taught me well. The foot bone's connected to the knee bone, the knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. Peristrophe Halliana sighs a sleepy sigh of pleasure-pain. I move my fingers beneath her eyeball, the tiniest blade concealed between middle and index. Nudge it out when the fingers are in place and softly slice the root. She groans. I tug at the globe and it releases with a gentle squelch and click. <br> Those are pearls that were her eyes, I sing. From her remaining right eye, she gazes at me with love. <br> I give her another couple of slugs of mother moonshine. Then, careful, so careful, I work my blade on the right. Again, the root. Another squelch, another click. I let her eyelids fall. <br> I lay the precious harvest out on ice brought down from the mountains by our first year initiates, all thirteen-year-old girls from Grist Village. At the door to my cave, Auntie Radix's groom is waiting. Soon the eyes that are darkening in that old doubler's head will shine bright as halogen headlights. Not that I've ever seen halogen headlights but I know the songs. Baby you can drive my car, yes, I'm gonna be a star... I know what stars are. They twinkle a little. They light up my life. I know what cars are too. They are what the people from the time before used to get around, instead of walking. They doubled as wheelbarrows, for transporting food and herbs and stuff. My mother double Glorybind Groundsel teaches me all the songs and all the history she remembers. "You must hold these things, Kirilow," she tells me. "We hold all that remains of the old world's knowledge in our bald brains. That means we need to be extra smart." <br> When Auntie Radix asks for Peristrophe Halliana's heart, I tell her no. No go, Joe. I'm at her bedside, summoned here after her new groom cut her wrong. Her old groom died last year of the flu and her new groom is young and green -- too green for the job she does. She should still be running ice down from the mountains with the other initiates. Her small hands are dexterous but unpracticed. Her eyes glow the emerald green of excess forget-me use. <br> Green grow the rushes grow, I sing. The new groom doesn't sing with me. She doesn't know this song. The initiates have no one to teach them the rhymes of the time before. <br> I feel dirty, cutting Auntie Radix for her, slipping my digits into Auntie Radix's floppy sockets. This isn't the ritual. This isn't the way it's done. The chivalry of the shiv says each groom takes care of her own -- doubler or starfish, depending on fate. But you don't take care of another groom's sexy suture. It's not right, it's not light, it'll make the world go the other way round. These are desperate times. Can a bank change? Can a grist? <br> I stay with Old Radix and her new groom until the satellite Eng rises on the southern horizon, blue and full. The elites of Salt Water City control her insides but we can still enjoy her glow. Eng is strong tonight. Her gravity pulls at my heart and makes it ache, so lonely without you. I should get back to Peristrophe Halliana. <br> That's when Auntie Radix blinks her peepers open, gazes at me through the true brown eyes of my own best beloved. Jeepers creepers. <br> "My heart is failing, Kirilow," she says, misty mournful as sad, fat Eng. <br> Oh no, I think, but I don't say it. She's our last doubler. The teachings of Our Mother say<br> Behold, the last<br> Doubler is gold<br> I sat that class carefully. <br> <br> It means, Glorybind Groundsel told me, if the Grist is dying down to the last doubler, her word is flesh, her word is god. You can't say no. <br> All my fibres scream it. No more I love yous. My own heart howls like a child's. But my mouth says, "I don't quite get your meaning, Auntie." <br> She takes a deep breath, then narrows her eyes. "Arrhythmia, Kirilow. Don't pretend you don't understand." <br> I rack my brain for teachings about the last starfish, but I can't think of any. To give again so soon will kill Peristrophe Halliana. Not that Auntie Radix cares. Somehow, I make my excuses. I escape Auntie Radix's dark cave. <br> Eng rides high in the sky as I set off for home. Her metallic light illuminates the trees and the forest floor making everything glimmer ghostly. A slight breeze kicks up and the branches of the trees begin to sway and undulate like human arms. Below the bluff that shapes the path between my cave and Auntie Radix's, I see something shift and jerk against the wind. The bluff rides high and steep over the valley below, and a mist obscures my vision. At first I think the movement is just a wind eddy, but then there is a red flash of hair. A biped, like us. One of those sneaky creeps from Salt Water City in all likelihood. But unlike us, tall, pale and gangly. Our genes don't express like that. We manifest crow-black hair, olive skin and short legs. I shudder, remembering last year's militia attack. We were lucky. It was a small advance guard, and we got them all. In my humble opinion, we should have moved the village afterwards, but Auntie Radix was against it. <br> I track the Salty along the edge of the bluff, meek and sweet as hello kitty. I catch a whiff of its shit and sweat stink on an updraft, and gag softly. <br> It stumbles into a clearing. I throw a knife at it, neatly severing its left hand. It screams and dashes in to the brush. <br> The severed hand lies there in clearing, reflecting Eng's metallic light. Blood pools from the cut veins. I step off the path onto the loose gravel and spindly sage that gives to the valley below. My first step lands solid, but the second sets a cascade of gravel flowing down the escarpment. I ride it, thankful for the sturdy elk skin boots that Peristrophe Halliana sewed for me while recovering from her last surgery. <br> I walk cautiously forward, brace through thighs to keep it slow and steady though the slope wants me to run. When I think it can't get any steeper, the path becomes a straight drop. I turn around and climb backwards as though down a ladder. When I reach the narrow ledge at the bottom of the drop, I turn again. A pair of eyes watches me from the forest just beyond the clearing. The Salty I saw? What if there is a full Salt Water City militia in the forest, watching, and waiting to ambush me? <br> My gaze darts between the eyes in the forest and the severed hand, that gleaming horde of genetic treasure, right there in the middle of the clearing. If I were smart, I'd leave it, bide for a better chance, when I have Glorybind Groundsel or a posse of initiates with me. I'm not smart. I scramble the rest of the way down, half running, half rolling, and dash through rough bush and brambles into the clearing. The Salty rushes out then. Dives in to the clearing, blood still dripping from its hastily bound wound. It snatches up the severed hand just seconds before I get there, then lurches back into the woods. I tear after it, muttering Our Mother who art artful, Our Mother of moss... I follow the shuddering of the trees and the intermittent blood spatter staining needles, earth, leaves and stone. I run so fast I don't realize I've arrived at Mourning Rock until I'm there. The forest lies dead still. The Salty is nowhere to be seen. <br> "What do you suppose it was looking for?" I ask Peristrophe Halliana when I get back to our cozy cave. Her eyelids flicker open but her new eyes are mere buds. It's just as well she can't see me in my torn tunic, covered in bruises and burrs. <br> "Us," I suspect, she says. "You better catch it." She closes her eyes again and flops back on to her mushroom fibre pillow. <br> I see the Salty again, two days later, running below Seven Sisters Bluff. My mother double Glorybind Groundsel and I are out harvesting forget-me-do-- our most precious crop, seeded through salal, fringe cup and trillium. The trees rustle and shiver below as the creature moves through them. It steps into an open patch of light, and stops. I draw my opera glasses out of their pouch and whip them up to my eyes. It's the same Salty I saw two days ago, grey-eyed and weak now. I rush along the bluff above it, follow as it stumbles, delirious and panicked at the same time. A clearing opens ahead of it. I take my chances and hurry ahead to a waiting spot just above the clearing. Watch like a young coyote, eyes intent, tail twitching. Quick as a brown fox, I drop a womb bomb over it -- Glorybind Groundsel's latest invention, designed precisely for such purposes. With a quick sharp tug I draw the womb bomb tight, bundling the thing neatly. It shrieks like a wounded rabbit as I rush down the bluff to where it flails. Whistle for my mother double. <br> Glorybind Groundsel emerges from the trees seconds after I reach the sobbing Salty. These creatures are so pathetic, I don't understand how they could ever have disdained us, much less expelled us from Salt Water City. <br> "Whenever I want you, all I have to do is dream," I tell it. "So shut up, Little Suzie." <br> The thing whimpers. <br> My mother double says, "There's no need to be so cruel, Kirilow." <br> I glare at her. I say nothing but lead her gaze with my own to its stump. A new hand is growing there, small and poorly formed, but clearly distinguishable. <br> "It can starfish," she mouths. <br> I nod. <br> "Let me go," blubbers the thing. <br> I yank the womb bomb tighter. "I've got you under my skin," I croon. And then, "By the foulest breath of Our Mother, would you please shut up?" <br> It falls to weeping again. <br> "I can't stand these things, Mother Glorybind," I say. I pull out my needles. <br> "When will you grow out of this murderous phase?" sighs...</p><h2>Lost Cities of North &amp; Central America (Lost Cities Series)</h2><p>From the jungles of Central America to the deserts of the southwest down the back roads from coast to coast, maverick archaeologist and adventurer David Hatcher Childress takes the reader deep into unknown America.

More significantly, this is an introduction to a mature level of Wicca called "reclaiming," a model of witchcraft that blends magic, personal growth, and activism. The book begins with the first chapter of the fairy tale, in which a foolish queen wishes to exchange her 12 sons for a daughter. An old woman "dressed all in black" overhears the queen and makes the wish come true, granting the queen a daughter but turning her sons into wild swans.<p> From here the coauthors launch into a back-and-forth structure of telling the story and then stopping to show how it applies to a witch's initiation and transformation. For example, we all must leave the castle in order to heal our past. We all must spend some time wandering in the wilderness before finding our true home, and we all must conquer some form of "wicked vows" before we can reach full maturity. These are wise leaders and strong guides, well worth following on this life-altering fairy tale. <i>--Tara West</i></p>Starhawk is the author of nine books, including her bestselling <em>The Spiral Dance, The Pagan Book of Living and Dying,</em> and <em>Webs of Power,</em> winner of the 2003 Nautilus Award for social change.

Consisting of 108 pages of hand-painted illustrations, <i>Red</i> is a groundbreaking mix of imagery from the indigenous Haida culture and Japanese manga. Red is the prideful leader of a small village in the islands off the northwest coast of British Columbia. His sister was abducted years ago by a band of raiders, and when news comes that she has been spotted in a nearby village, Red sets out to rescue his sister and exact revenge on her captors. Tragic and timeless, it is reminiscent of such classic stories as <i>Oedipus Rex</i> and <i>Macbeth.</i> An action-packed and dazzling graphic novel, <i>Red</i> is also a cautionary tale about the devastating effects of rage and retribution.</p><p><b>Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas</b> is a visual artist, storyteller and public speaker. Born and raised on the north Pacific islands of Haida Gwaii, he melds his cultural and political experiences as an indigenous person with contemporary graphic literature to produce a unique genre called Haida Manga. His work has been enthusiastically received internationally and is published in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Spain, the United States and Canada (English and French). His books include <i>Flight of the Hummingbird</i>, <i>A Tale of Two Shamans</i> and <i>Hachidori</i>, a bestseller in Japan. He lives in Canada with his wife and daughter, close to the Two Sisters mountains on an island in the Salish Sea.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;Red's life is changed forever when his sister is kidnapped by raiders. As years pass and he rises to power in his small village off the coast of British Columbia, he dreams of elaborate scenarios for getting even with the people who took her away from him. When his revenge fantasy is finally fulfilled, it turns out to be both his greatest victory and his tragic downfall. The idea of "Haida manga," an artistic fusion invented by Yahgulanaas, might cause confusion among readers, or at least send them running to Google to find out what "Haida" is. This artistic style, used by the Haida tribe of Native Americans, will be familiar to readers who have seen the stylized faces on totem poles. The bright and colorful artwork is definitely unique, but sometimes it is so overwhelming that it overpowers the story, which might leave readers confused about plot details. "I welcome you to destroy this book" is never something a librarian wants to hear, but that's what Yahgulanaas encourages his readers to do in order to assemble each page into a "formline illustration." It is only when the pages are assembled in this manner that readers will be able to see how every panel connects to other panels and appreciate the true complexity and vision of Yahgulanaas's art. Luckily, this "complete" image is reproduced at the end of the book and inside the dust jacket, so readers should not find it necessary to vandalize more library books than usual.&#x2014;<i>Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

Within both human and equine bodies these form lines of pull , affecting posture, movement, stability and mobility. Through clear &#39;how-to&#39; descriptions, coupled with copious illustrations, the reader learns how to rebalance the tension within and between one&#39;s own lines of pull . The ultimate task is to use this developing awareness to rebalance the tension in the horse&#39;s line of pull, gaining much more influence over his carriage and movement. The secrets of talented riders are laid bare. About The Author Mary Wanless BSc BHSI developed an effective method of teaching, based on an understanding of the biomechanical demands of riding and the communication styles that make riding skills easy to learn.

Rider Biomechanics is an incredibly detailed book, beautifully illustrated with colourful diagrams and photographs which show the influence of the body, including the front and back lines as well as the influence the arms and spinal position has on the rider's ability to help or hinder the horse. This is such a long way away from the instructions of old where we were merely told to have a straight line from the horse's mouth to our elbows. I am sure there must be many a horse who, with a rider who is aware of what their body is doing, must think `thank goodness for Mary Wanless!'. - Jacqui Broderick, Horse &amp; Pony Ireland; 'Mary teaches a centred, balanced approach to riding that's light years away from the `heels down, head up' approach that many of us learnt as children. In her new book, she concentrates on using the fascial system and core muscles to build a deeply balanced riding position that's in tune with the way the horse moves.' - Horse &amp; Countryside</p><h2>The Art of War: Sun Zi&#39;s Military Methods (Translations from the Asian Classics)</h2><p>Compiled during the Warring States period of 475-221 B.C.E., <i>The Art of War</i> has had an enormous impact on the development of Chinese military strategy over the past two thousand years and occupies an important place in East Asian intellectual history.

Lamsa brings an understanding to Psalm 23 that could only come from the first-hand experience of the Bible-land shepherd. Dr. Lamsa is primarily remembered for his momentous accomplishments in the field of translating Biblical Aramaic. But Lamsa&#39;s unique background enabled him to contribute to Biblical research in another powerful way. Born in the remote, unchanged lands located in the basin of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, he grew up in a culture where the customs, manners, and idioms, as well as the language of the Bible itself had been preserved throughout the centuries. Lamsa was raised in a family of shepherds, the occupation of his ancestors for generations. And from that understanding of the life, ways, and heart of the shepherd of the East, the reader comes to know the heart of the good shepherd like never before.</p><p>By virtue of his birth place, linguistic ability, and his scholarly achievements, George M. Lamsa was ideally suited to accomplish his outstanding contribution to the field of Biblical research. It was the remote part of ancient Biblical lands, which George Lamsa identified as his birthplace. Here he grew up speaking Aramaic in a culture where the customs, manners, and idioms, as well as the language of the Bible had been preserved throughout the centuries. Lamsa began his study of the ancient Aramaic Biblical texts under the tutelage of the Assyrian Church. He continued his education at the Archbishop of Canterbury College in Iran and Turkey, graduating with the highest honors ever bestowed and receiving the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Theology of the Church of the East. After immigrating to the United States following World War I, he furthered his studies at the Episcopal Virginia Theological Seminary and Dropsie College of Hebrew and Cognate Learning, now known as The Center for Advanced Judaic Studies (CAJS) at the University of Pennsylvania, which is the world's only institution exclusively dedicated to post-doctoral research on Jewish Civilization. George M. Lamsa was also distinguished as a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Arts, (FRSA). Dr. Lamsa dedicated his life to the work of translating the ancient texts into English and traveling the country to generate awareness and interest in Aramaic. His first work in Aramaic translations, Four Gospels, was published in 1933; followed by New Testament According to the Eastern Text in 1940. His culminating work, Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts in 1956, presented a translation of the Aramaic texts into easily understood modern English based upon the wording style of the KJV. He also wrote several other books, describing the customs and manners of early Christians. Dr. George M. Lamsa's legacy is widely seen today in the field of Biblical research. Lamsa&#x2019;s pioneering work, including the notable Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts, provided invaluable resources for Biblical scholars and kindled a widespread interest in the long neglected, yet crucial, primary Aramaic texts. Moreover, his life and work has directly led to even more valuable works by others, providing additional works in the translation and study of Biblical Aramaic. The background of Lamsa's life and heritage evidence God's calling and hand on the life of a man chosen for an important work.</p><h2>The Changing Face of the Priesthood: A Reflection on the Priest&#39;s Crisis of Soul</h2><p><p>Few today would contest that the priesthood is in a state of crisis. The nature and implications of that crisis, however, remain the subject of considerable discussion and debate. In <i>The Changing Face of the Priesthood</i>, Fr. Donald Cozzens offers insight into the crisis by reflecting on the issues, challenges, concerns, and realities of the priesthood today.</p> <p>The same year that Pope John XXIII surprised the Catholic world with his call for an ecumenical council, Cozzens began his formal study of theology. As a seminarian he felt the shaking of the priesthood's foundations. The very face of the priesthood was evolving even as he arrived at his first parish assignment. A generation later, the face of the priesthood continues to reveal new contours, fascinating features, and sadly, some tragic blemishes.</p> <p>In <i>The Changing Face of the Priesthood</i>, Cozzens takes a long, honest look at the present state of the priesthood. He provides this examination not merely from an empirical, scientific perspective but also from a personal, pastoral perspective. Drawing on clinical data, church documents, and his nearly forty years of pastoral experience, Cozzens gives shape and form to the changing face of the priesthood. Through his reflections he leads readers to both concern and hope for the priesthood of the twenty-first century.</p> <p>Chapters are Discovering an Identity," *Guarding One's Integrity, - *Loving as a Celibate, - *Facing the Unconscious, - *Becoming a Man, - *Tending the Word, - *Considering Orientation, - *Betraying Our Young, - and *The Changing Face of the Priesthood. - </p> <p>Donald Cozzens, PhD, a priest and writer, is author of two award-winning titles, <i>Sacred Silence</i> and <i>The Changing Face of the Priesthood</i>, and editor of <i>The Spirituality of the Diocesan Priest</i>, all published by Liturgical Press. He is writer in residence at John Carroll University where he teaches in the religious studies department.</p>"</p><p><i>The Changing Face of the Priesthood</i> is a remarkable survey of the state of American Catholic clergy today. Donald Cozzens, the president-rector of Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology in Cleveland, combines personal reflection and analysis of empirical data in this brief but wide-ranging book. To explain the shrinking of clerical ranks that has occurred in recent decades, Cozzens tells a familiar story: "As the vision of the [Second Vatican Council] became ever clearer, the cultic, pre-conciliar model of priesthood entered into a creative balance with the servant-leader model. The clear identity, the unquestioned status, the exalted privilege--features that helped priests deal with the sacrifices and crosses inherent to their vocation--began to blur." With astonishing candor, Cozzens also zeroes in on some of the more provocative issues among clergy; his discussions of celibacy, homosexuality, and sexual abuse of children are particularly insightful. Each of these discussions is driven by the author's fascination with the way that priests since Vatican II have "haltingly acknowledged a need, linked to the very soul of their spirituality, for authentic, human intimacy." This is a smart and loving way of understanding some of the biggest problems of the priesthood. And readers who learn to emulate this book's clear-eyed compassion will gain great advantage in that never-ending process of helping to heal the church. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Donald Cozzens--priest, writer, and lecturer--teaches in the religious studies department at John Carroll University.

Here are four of his greatest works: <i>Ghosts, An Enemy of the People, The Lady From the Sea,</i> and <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i>.</p><p><b>Henrik Ibsen</b> was born of well-to-do parents at Skien, a small Norwegian coastal town, on March 20, 1828. In 1836 his father went bankrupt, and the family was reduced to near poverty. At the age of fifteen, he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Grimstad. In 1850 Ibsen ventured to Christiania<b> </b>present-day Oslo<b> </b>as a student, with the hope of becoming a doctor. On the strength of his first two plays he was appointed &#x201c;theater-poet&#x201d; to the new Bergen National Theater, where he wrote five conventional romantic and historical dramas and absorbed the elements of his craft. In 1857 he was called to the directorship of the financially unsound Christiania Norwegian Theater, which failed in 1862. In 1864, exhausted and enraged by the frustration of his efforts toward a national drama and theater, he quit Norway for what became twenty-seven years of voluntary exile abroad. In Italy he wrote the volcanic <b>Brand</b> (1866), which made his reputation and secured him a poet&#x2019;s stipend from the government. Its companion piece, the phantasmagoric <b>Peer Gynt</b>, followed in 1867, then the immense double play, <b>Emperor and Galilean</b> (1873), expressing his philosophy of civilization. Meanwhile, having moved to Germany, Ibsen had been searching for a new style. With <b>The Pillars of Society</b> he found it; this became the first of twelve plays, appearing at two-year intervals, that confirmed his international standing as the foremost dramatist of his age. In 1900 Ibsen suffered the first of several strokes that incapacitated him. He died in Oslo on May 23, 1906.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Norwegian</p><h2>Exposition of the Gospel of John (Three Volumes Complete and Unabridged in One)</h2><p><p>An unforgettably beautiful picture of our Lord is drawn for God's people in the beloved Gospel of John. The promises in this Fourth Gospel have brought to weary hearts down through the centuries the sudden delight of the traveler who, crossing a desert, suddenly comes upon the cool, tranquil comfort of a green-bordered oasis. Thoroughly scholastic and yet vigorously practical, this exposition of the beloved Gospel (a verse-by-verse running commentary) is not a "hasty production." The author has already devoted fifteen years of special study to John's Gospel and taught the book to five different classes in the course of as many pastorates besides lecturing on it frequently from the Bibles conference platform. He has diligently sought to do two things (and accomplished them with praiseworthy distinction): (1) obtain from God the meaning of the text, and (2) apply its lessons most effectively to his hearers and readers.</p></p><p>Arthur W. Pink has held various pastorates in the United States. He has been engaged in Bible conference work in the United States, Australia, and other countries and resided in Scotland up until the time of his death, July 15, 1952. Pink was the author of various books and booklets on Bible exposition, as well as the editor and publisher of a Bible study magazine, Studies in the Scriptures.</p><h2>Mastering the Art of War: Zhuge Liang&#39;s and Liu Ji&#39;s Commentaries on the Classic by Sun Tzu (Shambhala Dragon Editions)</h2><p>Composed by two prominent statesmen-generals of classical China, this book develops the strategies of Sun Tzu's classic, <i>The Art of War, </i> into a complete handbook of organization and leadership. The great leaders of ancient China who were trained in Sun Tzu's principles understood how war is waged successfully, both materially and mentally, and how victory and defeat follow clear social, psychological, and environmental laws. Drawing on episodes from the panorama of Chinese history, <i>Mastering the Art of War </i> presents practical summaries of these essential laws along with tales of conflict and strategy that show in concrete terms the proper use of Sun Tzu's principles. The book also examines the social and psychological aspects of organization and crisis management. The translator's introduction surveys the Chinese philosophies of war and conflict and explores in depth the parallels between <i>The Art of War </i> and the oldest handbook of strategic living, the <i>I Ching </i> (Book of Changes).</p><p>velops the strategies of THE ART OF WAR into a handbook of organization and leadership.Thomas Cleary holds a PhD in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University and a JD from the University of California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law.

Their divorce triggered her first forays into drinking at age twelve and dovetailed with her passion for punk rock and playing the drums. Patty's struggles with her sexuality further drove her notoriously hard playing, and by the late '80s she had focused that anger, confusion, and drive into regular gigs with well-regarded bands in Tacoma, Seattle, and Olympia, Washington. She met a pre-Nirvana Kurt Cobain at a Melvins show, and less than five years later, was living with him and his wife, Hole front-woman Courtney Love, at the height of his fame and on the cusp of hers. As the platinum-selling band's new drummer, Schemel contributed memorable, driving beats to hits like "Beautiful Son," "Violet," "Doll Parts," and "Miss World." But the band was plagued by tragedy and heroin addiction, and by the time Hole went on tour in support of their ironically titled and critically-acclaimed album <i>Live Through This</i> in 1994, both Cobain and Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff had died at the age of 27<br><br>With surprising candor and wit, Schemel intimately documents the events surrounding her dramatic exit from the band in 1998 that led to a dark descent into a life of homelessness and crime on the streets of Los Angeles, and the difficult but rewarding path to lasting sobriety after more than twenty serious attempts to get clean. <i>Hit So Hard</i> is a testament not only to the enduring power of the music Schemel helped create but an important document of the drug culture that threatened to destroy it.<br></p><p><b>Patty Schemel </b>is an American drummer, songwriter, and comedian best known for her work with the platinum-selling band Hole. She is on the board of the Rock 'n' Roll Camp for Girls in California, a non-profit organization that teaches girls all over the world that it's okay to be loud. She continues to perform, teach, and tour, currently with the band Upset, and lives in Los Angeles with her wife and daughter."Reading about the myriad ways Hole drummer Patty Schemel--'the best musician in that band' as her pal Kurt Cobain put it--brutalized herself with addiction can feel like a kind of sadistic experience. And yet, <i>Hit So Hard</i> feels ultimately uplifting and hopeful, in part because its author so fully and completely appreciates what she's survived in order to have written it. <i>Hit So Hard</i> is a harrowing but heartwarming read. Schemel's made the years she got that others didn't count. And it shows."&#x2015;<b>Lizzy Goodman, author of Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011</b><br><br>"Patty Schemel has lived a million lives and come out the other side. An amazing story, amazing book."&#x2015;<b>Mark Lanegan</b><br><br><i>"Hit So Hard</i> is a compulsive read about the best worst times of a music scene torn apart by darkness and overshadowed by myth. Schemel writes with clear-eyed bravery about the chronic disease of addiction and offers hope for anyone still struggling to survive the '90s."&#x2015;<b>Jillian Lauren, author of Some Girls and Everything You Ever Wanted</b><br><br>"Often harrowing, frequently heartrending, and always insightful, <i>Hit So Hard</i> is far more than rock myth-making or a redemption story. In looking back unflinchingly at the literal highs and crushing lows of her life, Schemel's yielded a complex, compellingly readable memoir that possesses a truth and humanity few books of its kind ever truly capture."&#x2015;<b>Bob Mehr, New York Times bestselling author of Trouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements</b><br><br>"Patty Schemel's drums have always been a wake-up call, the punctuation that makes serious the wild streams of punk consciousness her bands have expressed. This book is a wake-up call, too: a clearly considered, deeply honest look back at a rock scene that's often been mourned but rarely truly understood. Schemel writes most honestly about herself: she spares nothing and no one as she traces the path of addiction as it intersects with the privileges and costs of young fame.

Any seasoned or would-be homiletician who does not come across something in this book to stir his or her blood had better check their pulse.' -- Alan Rathe, author of (the forthcoming) Evangelicals, Worship, and Participation: Turn-of-the-Millennium Reading<br><br>'Len Sweet provides a fresh and much needed perspective of preaching that goes far beyond the reductionist approaches dominating homiletics today. He helps preachers see and communicate scriptural truths in far more holistic, understandable, memorable, and moving ways. The New Testament shows us that Jesus&#x2019; own approach to preaching was filled with narrative and metaphor. Sweet taps into long-forgotten, yet indispensable, communication tools and provides a comprehensive manual that is valuable for those starting out in ministry as well as experienced preachers who see the need for a fresh approach to reach today&#x2019;s listeners.' -- Alan Ehler, Dean, College of Christian Ministry and Religion, Southeastern University, Lakeland, Florida<br><br>'Simply put, Giving Blood is the primer for the art of semiotic preaching and is destined to become a true preaching paradigm shifter.' -- James Merritt, Lead Pastor at Cross Pointe Church<br><br>'Len Sweet has done it again! Giving Blood offers a much-needed transfusion both for those in the pulpit and those in the pew. Len is the Duke Ellington of homileticians: his intricately woven metaphors inspire us away from preaching models that are incompatible with culture and toward the relational, improvisational ones we find Jesus embodying on the pages of the gospels. This kind of preaching offers lifeblood to preachers and their churches. You'll want to read this book -- it's good to the last drop!' -- Dr. Jay Richard Akkerman, Professor of Preaching and Pastoral Theology, Northwest Nazarene University, Nampa, Idaho<br><br>'Bold and accessible, Giving Blood will revitalize pastors and communities suffering the deadly effects of stale preaching and pump new life into the twenty-first century church. Refreshing!' -- Wendy J. Deichmann, PhD, President, United Theological Seminary<br><br>'Leonard Sweet is an atypical theologian and one of the most insightful spiritual thinkers of the 21st century. In this book he has accurately diagnosed the spiritual condition of our contemporary culture and found it in need of life &#x2013; the life that is in the blood. He has detected the inability of spiritual physicians to dispense the very life-blood needed by their patients, those who fill the pews and the corridors of our culture. Dying men and women come to the emergency room of the church in need of trauma specialists. Sweet invites us to go with him on rounds as we hone our skills in dispensing life.' -- Bishop Kenneth C. Ulmer, Senior Pastor/Teacher, Faithful Central Bible Church, Los Angeles<br><br>'Label this book 'O Negative'. It is rare and urgently needed. Good for all types.' -- Heather Murray Elkins, Professor of Worship, Preaching, and the Arts, Drew University</p><h2>Thrilled to Death: How the Endless Pursuit of Pleasure Is Leaving Us Numb</h2><p><p><strong>A fascinating exploration of the profound loss of pleasure in our daily lives and the seven steps for restoring it.</strong></p><p>Pleasure. We know what it feels like and many of us spend our days trying to experience it. But can too much pleasure actually be bad for us? Yes, says Dr. Archibald Hart, clinical psychologist and expert in behavorial psychology. Backed by recent brain-imaging research, Dr. Hart shares that to some extent, our pursuit of extreme and overstimulating thrills hijacks our pleasure system and robs us of our ability to experience pleasure in simple things. We are literally being <em>thrilled to death</em>.</p><p>In this insightful book, Dr. Hart explores the stark rise in a phenomenon known as <em>anhedonia</em>, an inability to experience pleasure or happiness. Previously linked only to serious emotional disorders, anhedonia is now seen as a contributing factor in depression (specifically nonsadness depression) and in the growing number of people who complain of profound boredom. This emotional numbness and loss of joy are results of the overuse of our brain's pleasure circuits. In <em>Thrilled to Death</em>, Dr. Hart explains the processes of the brain's pleasure center, the damaging trends of overindulgence and overstimulation, the signs and problems of anhedonia, and the seven important steps we must take to recover our wonderful joy in living.</p></p><p>Dr. Hart is a professional psychologist, a prolific writer and well-known speaker. He covers different topics including the treatment of panic attacks and depression as well as stress.</p><h2>Staying Alive: Women, Ecology, and Development</h2><p>Inspired by women&#x2019;s struggles for the protection of nature as a condition for human survival, award-winning environmentalist Vandana Shiva shows how ecological destruction and the marginalization of women are not inevitable, economically or scientifically. She argues that &#x201c;maldevelopment&#x201d;&#x2014;the violation of the integrity of organic, interconnected, and interdependent systems that sets in motion a process of exploitation, inequality, and injustice&#x2014;is dragging the world down a path of self-destruction, threatening survival itself. Shiva articulates how rural Indian women experience and perceive ecological destruction and its causes, and how they have conceived and initiated processes to arrest the destruction of nature and begin its regeneration. Focusing on science and development as patriarchal projects, <i>Staying Alive</i> is a powerfully relevant book that positions women not solely as survivors of the crisis, but as the source of crucial insights and visions to guide our struggle.</p><p>Vandana Shiva is a physicist, world-renowned environmental thinker and activist, and a tireless crusader for economic, food, and gender justice. She is the author and editor of many influential books, including <i>Making Peace with the Earth, Earth Democracy, Soil Not Oil, Stolen Harvest, Water Wars, </i>and<i> Globalization&#x2019;s New Wars</i>. Dr. Shiva is the recipient of more than twenty international awards, among them the Right Livelihood Award (1993); the John Lennon-Yoko Ono Grant for Peace (2008); The Sydney Peace Prize (2010); and the Calgary Peace Prize (Canada, 2011). In addition, she is a board member of the World Future Council and one of the leaders and board members of the International Forum on Globalization (whose other members include Jerry Mander, Edward Goldsmith, Ralph Nader, and Jeremy Rifkin). She travels frequently to speak at conferences around the world.&#x201c;Vandana Shiva is one of the world's most prominent radical scientists. In <i>Staying Alive </i>she defines the links between ecological crises, colonialism, and the oppression of women. It is a scholarly and polemical plea for the rediscovery of the &#x2018;feminine principle&#x2019; in human interaction with the natural world, not as a gender-based quality, rather an organizing principle, a way of seeing the world.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;<i>The Guardian<br></i>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Extraordinary in the ease of its global and historical scopes and the clarity of its arguments.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014;<i>Women&#x2019;s Review of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;Laced with references to Hindu deities, hard-nosed research into Indian land use and bold attacks on Western science ... <i>Staying Alive</i> ... has the &#x2018;go&#x2019; of a big personality behind it.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>The Observer </i><br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;Shiva ... has devoted her life to fighting for the rights of the ordinary people of India....

A compelling adventure story, it is also a novel of profound psychological insight and of powerful political implications. It tells the story of a Central American state whose silver mine serves both literally and metaphorically as the source of the country&#x2018;s value. Written at the time of the development of the Panama Canal, <em>Nostromo</em> is set in the imaginary province of Sulaco, which secedes from the federation of Costaguana in order to protect its natural resource, the silver mine. The parallels with the &#x2018;revolution&#x2019; fomented in Panama by the United States in 1903 are striking; just as Panama seceded from Columbia to satisfy the material interests of the canal builders, so the secession of Sulaco serves the material interests of &#x2018;the Gould concession.&#x2019; In this edition a variety of documents from the period (including material concerning American involvement in Central America in the early twentieth century, early critical notices, and family letters of Conrad&#x2019;s) help to set the text in context. </p></p><h2>Eye of the Wolf (A Wind River Reservation Mystery)</h2><p><i>This is for the Indian priest.</i><p>The cryptic message was clearly meant for Father O&#x2019;Malley. The unemotional voice on the answering machine, speaking of revenge against old enemies, wanted O&#x2019;Malley to visit the site of the Bates Battle. In 1874, Shoshone warriors led Captain Alfred Bates&#x2019;s cavalry to Arapaho tribal grounds, and nearly everyone living there was massacred. As a nation, the Arapaho were finished, but their people survived. Now, someone has left three dead Shoshones on the old battlefield, positioned to mimic the bodies of those Arapaho killed in the historic slaughter.</p><p>Vicky Holden&#x2019;s latest client, Frankie Montana, has become the number one suspect in their deaths. Despite his less than sterling background, Vicky doesn&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;s capable of murder.

Bestseller Coel's descriptive artistry, as shown in her 11th whodunit (after 2004's <i>Wife of Moon</i>), surely makes her the James Lee Burke of Native American mystery writers. Readers will be immediately entrenched in the solid reality of the Wind River Reservation and Father John O'Malley's alarm on receiving a cryptic voice-mail message that leads him to a century-old battlefield and three newly slain Shoshones. Could these be revenge killings for the bloody battle that took place between the now co-existing Arapahos and Shoshones? When a client of Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden, Frankie Montana, is accused of the murders, Vicky's law partner and lover, Adam Lone Eagle, urges her to pass Montana to the attractive new lawyer in town. Past experience sets off her warning bells, and Vicky begins to wonder about Adam's interest in the beautiful blond newcomer. The wary familiarity between Vicky and Father John continues even as the two are drawn into an expanding circle of death.

Whether impersonating Sigmund Freud in a department store window during the holidays, climbing an icy mountain in cheap loafers, or learning primitive survival skills in the wilds of New Jersey, Rakoff clearly demonstrates how he doesn&#x2019;t belong&#x2013;nor does he try to. <br><br>In his debut collection of essays, Rakoff uses his razor-sharp wit and snarky humor to deliver a barrage of damaging blows that, more often than not, land squarely on his own jaw&#x2013;hilariously satirizing the writer, not the subject. Joining the wry and the heartfelt, <i>Fraud</i> offers an object lesson in not taking life, or ourselves, too seriously.</p><p>Let's get this out of the way: David Rakoff is not David Sedaris. When you hear him being incredibly smart and funny on <i>This American Life</i>, you invariably think, "Oh, it's David Sedaris." But if you listen closely, you can tell the difference. Rakoff, while no less witty or nasal, is a little more <i>disappointed</i>. In his first collection--a series of pieces for public radio and for various magazines--he positively revels in his world-weariness. Whether he's investigating the Loch Ness monster, attending a comedy festival in Aspen, Colorado, visiting a New Age retreat hosted by Steven Seagal, or just, you know, playing Freud in a department-store window at Christmastime, Rakoff tends to get comically depleted. Watching the comic Dan Castellaneta, for example, he writes, "It's a bad sign when I start counting the unused props on stage. Only two wigs, one stool, an easel, and a dropcloth to go. I begin to pray to an unfeeling God to please make Castellaneta multitask." In a piece where he attempts to climb a mountain (well... a very short hill), Rakoff immediately nips any Sierra Club fantasies in the bud: "I do not go outdoors. Not more than I have to. As far as I'm concerned, the whole point of living in New York City is indoors. You want greenery? Order the spinach." But in the end, what makes him such a terrific writer is that he's not only onto everyone else, he's onto himself. No wonder his visit to a kibbutz becomes the occasion for some supremely self-conscious amusement: "I know I sound like the Central Casting New Yorker I've turned myself into with single-minded determination when I say this, but the main problem with working in the fields is that the sun is just always shining." <i>--Claire Dederer</i>"Combining journalistic tenacity, literary smarts, and a talent for gut-busting one-liners, Rakoff reports on his wilted salad days . . . His blend of withering wit and self-effacing humor makes these essays soar." &#x2013;<i>Entertainment Weekly<br><br></i>"Rakoff possesses a sociologist's eye for places where today&#x2019;s consoling myths reside."<br> &#x2013;<i>New York Times<br><br></i>"David Rakoff&#x2019;s <i>Fraud</i> showcases his rapier wit, slashing in all directions with slice-of-life insights and cutting remarks, sometimes nicking himself with self-deprecation in his dexterous duello with the American experience." &#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><i><br></i>"Rakoff likes to paint himself as urbane to a fault, an outsider anywhere unpaved. But then, in the woods or on a mountaintop, he reveals himself, despite his searing and hilarious observations, to be a completely unrelenting romantic." <br>&#x2013;Dave Eggers, author of <i>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius<br><br></i>"David Rakoff's hilarious, bittersweet stories are epic struggles&#x2013;between smoky bars and the great outdoors, management and labor, Santa Claus and Sigmund Freud, New York versus everywhere else, and, not least, neighbor-to-the-North against South. Rakoff is such an American original it turns out he&#x2019;s Canadian. <i>Vive</i> the brain drain!"<br> -Sarah Vowell, author of <i>Take the Cannoli</i></p><h2>The Quest for Shakespeare: The Bard of Avon and the Church of Rome</h2><p>Highly regarded and best-selling literary writer and teacher, Joseph Pearce presents a stimulating and vivid biography of the world s most revered writer that is sure to be controversial. Unabashedly provocative, with scholarship, insight and keen observation, Pearce strives to separate historical fact from fiction about the beloved Bard.<p>Shakespeare is not only one of the greatest figures in human history, he is also one of the most controversial and one of the most elusive. He is famous and yet almost unknown. Who was he? What were his beliefs? Can we really understand his plays and his poetry if we don t know the man who wrote them?</p><p>These are some of the questions that are asked and answered in this gripping and engaging study of the world s greatest ever poet. <i>The Quest for Shakespeare</i> claims that books about the Bard have got him totally wrong. They misread the man and misread the work. The true Shakespeare has eluded the grasp of the critics. Dealing with the facts of Shakespeare s life and times, Pearce's quest leads to the inescapable conclusion that Shakespeare was a believing Catholic living in very anti-Catholic times.</p><p>Many of his friends and family were persecuted, and even executed, for their Catholic faith. And yet he seems to have avoided any notable persecution himself. How did he do this? How did he respond to the persecution of his friends and family? What did he say about the dreadful and intolerant times in which he found himself? <i>The Quest for Shakespeare</i> answers these questions in ways that will enlighten and astonish those who love Shakespeare s work, and that will shock and outrage many of his critics. This book is full of surprises for beginner and expert alike.</p></p><p>"Joseph Pearce writes piercingly brilliant books. This is one of them. He usually writes dramatic biographies. This is not one of them. It is not a biography and it is the least dramatic book he has written. But it is also the most important one. To see its importance, try the following thought-experiment. Imagine a book that convincingly proved that Homer was a Jew, or that Milton was a lapsed Catholic, or that Dante was a proto-Protestant. The idea would have far-ranging consequences. It would cast a new light on everything we knew about Homer, or Milton, or Dante. In his next book Pearce will trace the consequences of Shakespeare's Catholicism in his plays. In this book, he proves it historically. I mean proves it. (Pearce would make a formidable lawyer.) The evidence is simply overwhelming." --<b>-Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</b>, Boston College, Author, <i>Summa of the Summa</i><br><br>"I've long suspected that there was a deep Catholic sensibility in the plays of Shakespeare an emphasis on man's powerlessness without grace, yet also an openness to the sacramentality of nature, and to the energetic work of dutiful yet often mistrusted or despised servants. Pearce shows that Shakespeare himself was such a dutiful servant, ever dutiful to the Queen, but to God first. He does not leap to conclusions, but builds a case that is meticulous, reasonable, and convincing." --<b>-Anthony Esolen, Ph.D.</b>, Providence College Professor of Renaissance English<br><br>"Joseph Pearce has brought together here a mass of material on the vexed question as to Shakespeare's religious affiliation a question which scholars have traditionally tried sedulously to ignore. But it is a question of more than merely neutral historic curiosity. Readers, I feel sure, will be quickly drawn in to the matter. Once again, we owe Mr. Pearce a great debt." --<b>-Thomas Howard, Ph.D.</b> Author, <i>Dove Descending: T. S. Eliot s Four Quartets</i>Clare Asquith&#x2019;s Shadowplay (2005) argued from cryptic literary evidence that Shakespeare was a Catholic, necessarily clandestine during his era, when to be so entailed huge fines, arrest, and even execution. Eschewing Asquith&#x2019;s method (merely pointing out a pun in the occasional sonnet), Pearce also concludes that Shakespeare was a Catholic and, indeed, that one must be prejudiced to insist otherwise. The evidence he cites shows that John Shakespeare&#x2019;s will was based on a Catholic model; that John and son William each left bequests and executorship to Catholics; that Shakespeare&#x2019;s daughters were named out of the Apocrypha (biblical writings by Catholic, but not Protestant, lights); that Shakespeare bought property that benefited Catholics, including a longtime venue for clandestine masses; that he was married by a Catholic priest miles away from his home parish; and so on and so on. Pearce also argues that Shakespeare&#x2019;s talent may have led the authorities to wink at his Catholicism, as they did with the gifted composer William Byrd. It helps Pearce that, as usual, he&#x2019;s a delight to read. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Falling Angels: A Novel</h2><p><b>A&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestseller<br><br>From the author of the international bestseller&nbsp;<i>Girl With A Pearl Earring </i>and <i>At the Edge of the Orchard,</i>&nbsp;Tracy Chevalier once again paints a distant age with a rich and provocative palette of characters.</b><br><br> <i>Falling Angels</i>&nbsp;follows the fortunes of two families in the emerging years of the twentieth century in England, while the Queen's death reverberates through a changing nation.&nbsp;Told through a variety of shifting perspectives&#x2014;wives and husbands, friends and lovers, masters and their servants, and a gravedigger's son&#x2014;<i>Falling Angels</i> is graced with the luminous imagery that distinguished Girl With a Pearl Earring, Falling Angels is another dazzling tour de force from this "master of voices" (<b>The New York Times Book Review</b>).</p><p>Set among the sweeping skirts and social upheavals of Edwardian London, Tracy Chevalier's <i>Falling Angels</i> is a meditation on change, loss, and recovery. Her central characters are two young girls of the same age, whose family plots are situated side-by-side in a cemetery modeled on Highgate. Lavinia Waterhouse is respectably middle-class, devoted, like her conventional, doting mother, to the right way to do things, although suspiciously well- schooled in subjects like funerary sculpture and the English practices of mourning. Her friend Maude Coleman comes from a slightly more privileged and free-thinking background. In contrast with Lavinia's mother, Maude's mother Kitty Coleman is well-educated by the standards of the day, and it has made her restless and irritable. But neither her reading, nor her gardening, nor her affair with the somber, high-thinking governor of the cemetery is enough for Kitty. She comes alive only when she discovers the women's suffrage movement, and her devotion to the cause takes her away from Maude in every sense.<p> Although the point of view shifts between many characters (with even the Coleman's maid and cook getting their say, sometimes unnecessarily), <i>Falling Angels</i> is essentially the children's story, since it is their lives that are most open to change. The narrative spans exactly the years of Edward VII's reign, from the morning after his mother Queen Victoria's death in January 1901 to his own death in May 1910. Chevalier (<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>) deftly uses the nation's dramatically different mourning for these two monarchs to signal the social transformations of the period. Readers at ease with English history will find <i>Falling Angels</i> an unusually subtle novel, with an emotional range that recalls the best of the Edwardian novelists, E.M. Forster, and his quintessential novel of Edwardian manners, <i>Howard's End</i>. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>"I was born and grew up in Washington, DC. After getting a BA in English from Oberlin College (Ohio), I moved to London, England in 1984. I intended to stay 6 months; I&#x2019;m still here.<p>"As a kid I&#x2019;d often said I wanted to be a writer because I loved books and wanted to be associated with them. I wrote the odd story in high school, but it was only in my twenties that I started writing &#x2018;real&#x2019; stories, at night and on weekends. Sometimes I wrote a story in a couple evenings; other times it took me a whole year to complete one.</p><p>"Once I took a night class in creative writing, and a story I&#x2019;d written for it was published in a London-based magazine called Fiction. I was thrilled, even though the magazine folded 4 months later.</p><p>I worked as a reference book editor for several years until 1993 when I left my job and did a year-long MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia in Norwich (England). My tutors were the English novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Rose Tremain. For the first time in my life I was expected to write every day, and I found I liked it. I also finally had an idea I considered &#x2018;big&#x2019; enough to fill a novel. I began <b>The Virgin Blue</b> during that year, and continued it once the course was over, juggling writing with freelance editing.</p><p>"An agent is essential to getting published. I found my agent Jonny Geller through dumb luck and good timing. A friend from the MA course had just signed on with him and I sent my manuscript of <b>The Virgin Blue</b> mentioning my friend&#x2019;s name. Jonny was just starting as an agent and needed me as much as I needed him. Since then he&#x2019;s become a highly respected agent in the UK and I&#x2019;ve gone along for the ride." <br><br>Tracy Chevalier is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of six previous novels, including <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>, which has been translated into thirty-nine languages and made into an Oscar-nominated film. Her latest novel is <i>The Last Runaway.</i> Born and raised in Washington, D.C., she lives in London with her husband and son. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Peace</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Bernie Gunther novels reimagines the end of World War 2 in this gripping standalone spy thriller.<br></b><i><br>Autumn 1943</i>. Since Stalingrad, Hitler has known that Germany cannot win the war. The upcoming Allied conference in Teheran will set the ground rules for their second front-and for the peace to come. Realizing that the unconditional surrender FDR has demanded will leave Germany in ruins, Hitler has put out peace feelers. (Unbeknownst to him, so has Himmler, who is ready to stage a coup in order to reach an accord.) FDR and Stalin are willing to negotiate. Only Churchill refuses to listen.<br><br>At the center of this high-stakes game of deals and doubledealing is Willard Mayer, an OSS operative who has been chosen by FDR to serve as his envoy.&nbsp;A cool, self-absorbed, emotionally distant womanizer with a questionable past, Mayer has embraced the stylish philosophy of the day, in which no values are fixed.&nbsp;He is the perfect foil for the steamy world of deception, betrayals, and assassinations that make up the moral universe of realpolitik.<br><br>With his sure hand for pacing, his firm grasp of historical detail, and his explosively creative imagination about what might have been, Philip Kerr has fashioned a totally convincing thinking man&#x2019;s thriller in the great tradition of Eric Ambler and Graham Greene.</p><p><b>Philip Kerr</b>&nbsp;is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels, two of which&#x2014;<i>Field Gray</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Lady from Zagreb</i>&#x2014;were finalists for the Edgar� Award for Best Novel. Kerr has also won several Shamus Awards and the British Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Ellis Peters Award for Historical Crime Fiction. As P. B. Kerr, he is the author of the much-loved young adult fantasy series Children of the Lamp.Fans of Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy will prize this briskly paced WWII-era spy thriller, which boasts plot twists that will keep readers' heads spinning even after they've put it down. For Willard Mayer, a 35-year-old Harvard-educated empirical philosopher, the roots of pro-Communist realpolitiking run deep. A former Princeton professor who was also a member of the Abwehr, Germany's military intelligence service, and an informer for Russia's notorious Internal Affairs Commissariat, the NKVD, Mayer during the war works as an intelligence analyst for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington&#x2014;which remains unaware of his past. En route to Tehran, at Roosevelt's insistence, for the Big Three conference in November 1943 aboard the USS<i> Iowa</i>, Mayer believes he's uncovered a plot to assassinate Joseph Stalin. Meanwhile, Hitler and Himmler, eager to avoid engaging the U.S. in a second European front, are trying to figure out how to get around Roosevelt's demand for an unconditional surrender. The ethically compromised Mayer finds himself in the thick of the negotiations even as larger plots are afoot, including one by an SS general to bomb Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill in Tehran. Kerr is as interested in backdoor diplomatic efforts as he is in espionage and assassination, and this highly entertaining spy fiction also explores the moral quandaries of war and realpolitik. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As Russia and Ukraine tussle for Crimea and the eastern regions, relations between Putin and the West have reached an all-time low. How did we get here? Richard Sakwa here unpicks the story of Russo-Ukrainian relations and traces the path to the recent disturbances through the events which have forced Ukraine, a country internally divided between East and West, to choose between closer union with Europe or its historic ties with Russia. As the first full account of the Ukraine crisis from the Euromaidan Protests to the catastrophe of MH17 and up to the October 2014 parliamentary elections, Frontline Ukraine explains the origins, developments and global significance of the internal and external battle for Ukraine. With all eyes focused on the region, Sakwa unravels the myths and misunderstandings of the situation, providing an essential and highly-readable account of the struggle for Europe s contested borderlands.&#34;</p><p>Richard Sakwa is Professor of Russian and European Politics at the University of Kent, an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, and a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences.

This frustration manifests itself as fighting, resentment, feelings of either guilt or rejection, and general marital strife. There are few safe and appropriate places to ask the questions about sex that frustrate and confuse women most. In <i>No More Headaches</i>, Juli Slattery provides that place with honest answers that target women&#x2019;s specific needs. Her warm and compassionate style come through as she examines the underlying issues that prevent couples from having a satisfying sex life. Helping husbands and wives understand and address the sexual relationship with their spouse will improve the marriage by reducing stress and frustration in that area, which will reduce stress in other areas of marriage as well. Each chapter contains questions for reflection and questions for couples to discuss. <b>Juli Slattery</b> has extensive experience speaking to women about marriage, parenting, and family issues at retreats and conferences as well as on television and radio.</p><p><i>&#x201c;My husband and I have such different expectations about how often to make love that we end up angry and frustrated.

One is fast, shiny, and ready to go; the other is a comfortable old jalopy, a little worse for wear but as reliable as can be. On a magic moonlit night, the doors of the garage swing open and they head out for a spin, each determined to prove that he is the &#x201c;best car on the road.&#x201d; Over hill and dale and roundabout they go, encountering&#x2014;and narrowly missing&#x2014;trains, trucks, wildlife, and even, in the form of a policeman on a motorcycle, the long arm of the law. Before the two cars&#x2019; nocturnal caper is over, each will have discovered the being the &#x201c;best&#x201d; is not so simple as you might suppose.</p><p><b>Edgar Parin d'Aulaire</b> (1898-1986) studied art in Germany and France, and worked with Henri Matisse. In Munich, he met<b> Ingri Mortenson</b> (1904-1980), a Norwegian-born art student. They married, emigrated to the US, and began a long career together, during which they published over twenty picture books for children. The Magic Rug was followed by Ola and East of the Sun and West of the Moon, both of which describe Norwegian folklore. Their work shifted to American history with Abraham Lincoln, a biography which won the 1940 Caldecott Medal. The d'Aulaires were awarded the Regina Medal from the Catholic Library Association in 1970."Several classic children's tales return to delight new generations of readers. <i>The Two Cars</i> by the distinguished author/illustrator team of Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire is a modern adaptation of The Tortoise and the Hare, in which safe and courteous driving wins the day. Delicate pencil illustrations and a plot delivered at a pace fit for a turnpike should prove as enchanting to today's automotively inclined children as when the book was first published in 1955." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;Whatever subject the well-known d&#x2019;Aulaires offer in picture and story to the nursery set will be welcomed eagerly, for they have understanding hearts...&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>&#x201c;The d&#x2019;Aulaires now add to their list of distinguished picture books a fable about two little cars...It&#x2019;s a jolly little tale with a surprise ending which is a good lesson for all of us.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Chicago Daily Tribune</i><br><br>&#x201c;<b>The Two Cars </b>is a modern story on the hare and tortoise motif for preschool children...by one of children&#x2019;s favorite illustrators.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;[T]his is a just right picture story for all small boys who consider automobiles the most fascinating things in all the world...The pictures are amusing and the personification of the automobiles is done with a masterly use of mechanical detail.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Soul Friends: The Transforming Power of Deep Human Connection</h2><p>"Most of us will have many friends throughout our lifetimes&#x2014;friends of all shapes, sizes, and callings. Many of these are wonderful, meaningful friendships. Some are difficult. But some magic few of these are connections that have gone right to our soul. These five or seven or ten friendships have been powerful keys to determining who we have become and who we will become. . . . These are the people I call Soul Friends." As the Senior Scholar-in-Residence for over 25 years at the renowned Kripalu Center, Stephen Cope has spent decades investigating&#x2014;and writing about&#x2014;the integration of body, mind, and spirit and the rich complexity of our relationships with others, and with ourselves. Perhaps the central truth that arises from his work is this: human beings are universally wired for one thing&#x2014;vital connection with one another.Soul Friends invites us on a compelling journey into the connectivity of the human psyche, the study of which has fascinated scholars, philosophers, and thinkers for centuries. Cope seamlessly blends science, scholarship, and storytelling, drawing on his own life as well as the histories of famous figures&#x2014;from Eleanor Roosevelt to Charles Darwin to Queen Victoria&#x2014;whose formative relationships shed light on the nature of friendship itself. In his exploration, he distills human connection into six distinct yet interconnected mechanisms: containment, twinship, adversity, mirroring, identification, and conscious partnership. Then he invites us to reflect on how these forms of connection appear in our own lives, helping us work toward a fuller understanding of "who we have become and who we will become."Without a doubt, the journey to our most fulfilled selves requires us to look within. But in order to truly thrive, we must make the most of who we are in relation to one another as well. Unsparingly honest, deeply wise, and irresistibly readable, Soul Friends gives us a map to find our way.</p><p>Stephen Cope is the Senior Scholar in Residence at Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He is a Western-trained psychotherapist who writes and teaches about the relationship between Western psychological paradigms and the Eastern contemplative traditions, and the best-selling author of such books as The Great Work of Your Life and Yoga and the Quest for the True Self. Stephen holds degrees from Amherst College and Boston College. He completed graduate and postgraduate training in psychoanalytic psychotherapy in the Boston area, where he practiced for many years before joining the staff at Kripalu.

We transmit signals through the dark, both hoping to find another and fearing what we may find. I am here. I hear you. I want to meet you. And, as we encounter another, in that meeting we complete ourselves&#x2014;or not. In Soul Friends, Stephen Cope urges us to explore the wonder of those we have loved and who have loved us in return, as well as those with whom we have collided, and who, through those collisions, have altered us in significant ways. This book will move you. It will make you go deep. You read it and discover your heart. You will laugh and cry.

We leave this remarkable book with a deeper understanding of (and longing for) the all too rare lightning-bolt moments of awareness of the connection with another person as a turning point in life. If we are lucky, those moments signal the beginning of a relationship that leaves us in an entirely new orientation, standing on new ground.

Her book&nbsp;<i>A Chorus of Stones</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. The recipient of an Emmy, a MacArthur Grant, and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, she is a frequent contributor to&nbsp;<i>Ms.</i>&nbsp;magazine, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>, and numerous other publications. She lives in Berkeley, California."Perhaps every moment of time lived in human consciousness remains in the air around us." With these words Susan Griffin begins to draw the connections between personal histories and the violent and often unspoken events of this century. Believing that "each solitary story belongs to a larger story," she tells us the sad and violent tale of her childhood. Her calm and mesmerizing style builds to a crescendo as she ties her memories to the life stories of more powerful individuals - the architects of modern war who have shaped our history. Susan Griffin presents some disturbingly provocative accounts of war's atrocities, the stories of bomb makers and bomb victims and the contents of once-classified government documents. Not only does she bring us face-to-face with the horrific underbelly of war and fascism, she makes us look fresh at our journey from innocent child to ruthless warmonger or war enabler. Adamant that society's gender biases continue to coerce men into the shadow of war, she challenges us to understand that not a shred of our violent past is ever forgotten, that in our conscious lives we have entered into a collective silence which erodes our ability to see truth and act responsibly. <b>A Chorus of Stones</b> is a profound and accessible book which infuses insight into the overwhelming moral dilemmas of our time. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Rebecca Sullivan</i></p><h2>Bowls of Plenty: Recipes for Healthy and Delicious Whole-Grain Meals</h2><p><b>A fresh and flexible approach to grain bowls--thoughtfully structured one-dish meals that marry health and flavor--from James Beard Award-winning journalist and acclaimed cookbook coauthor Carolynn Carreno.<br></b><br>Gorgeous, layered, satisfying bowls have become the next wave of healthy eating. From food blogs to Instagram, farm-to-table bistros to chain restaurants, "the bowl" has become part of our culinary vocabulary. And whole grains are not just for hippies and health nuts anymore! Hearty grains like quinoa, farro, millet, and spelt are replacing flour or corn tortillas, bread, pasta, white rice, and mashed potatoes as the base or vehicle for other, richer, more complex ingredients.<br><br>BOWLS OF PLENTY brings grain bowls to the home cook, offering more than 75 recipes for hearty, grain-centric, one-dish meals that layer flavorful veggies and delicious sauces and vinaigrettes, with optional meats and dairy on a foundation of whole-grain staples.

This one is intended for our son, but he's not quite old enough for it yet, so I read it to be prepared for when he eventually reads it.

Their treatment is a useful guide for anyone interested in understanding both the success of scientific methods and the limits, epistemic and moral, of scientific authority."--Bruce Glymour, <em>Kansas State University</em><p></p><br>"<em>Philosophy of Science: A New Introduction</em> is an excellent work that should become a standard text in introduction to philosophy of science courses for many years to come. Its best quality is the way in which it reorients the field of philosophy of science to questions of social and political relevance."--Justin B. Biddle, <em>Georgia Institute of Technology</em><p></p><br>"This is an excellent book written by two excellent scholars. I think that it is the first attempt to recast the format of classical philosophy of science textbooks to take into account how the field has changed since the mid-20th century.

Every chapter of this book contains excellent explanations and insights into the smaller but important decisions we continuously have to make when creating quality code and classes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2013;<i>Erich Gamma, IBM Distinguished Engineer</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>&#x201c;Many teams have a master developer who makes a rapid stream of good decisions all day long. Their code is easy to understand, quick to modify, and feels safe and comfortable to work with. If you ask how they thought to write something the way they did, they always have a good reason. This book will help you become the master developer on your team. The breadth and depth of topics will engage veteran programmers, who will pick up new tricks and improve on old habits, while the clarity makes it accessible to even novice developers.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2013;<i>Russ Rufer, Silicon Valley Patterns Group</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>&#x201c;Many people don&#x2019;t realize how readable code can be and how valuable that readability is. Kent has taught me so much, I&#x2019;m glad this book gives everyone the chance to learn from him.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2013;<i>Martin Fowler, chief scientist, ThoughtWorks</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>&#x201c;Code should be worth reading, not just by the compiler, but by humans. Kent Beck distilled his experience into a cohesive collection of implementation patterns. These nuggets of advice will make your code truly worth reading.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2013;<i>Gregor Hohpe, author of </i>Enterprise Integration Patterns</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;In this book Kent Beck shows how writing clear and readable code follows from the application of simple principles. <i>Implementation Patterns </i>will help developers write intention revealing code that is both easy to understand and flexible towards future extensions. A must read for developers who are serious about their code.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2013;<i>Sven Gorts</i> </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Implementation Patterns </i>bridges the gap between design and coding. Beck introduces a new way of thinking about programming by basing his discussion on values and principles.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x2013;<i>Diomidis Spinellis, author of </i>Code Reading <i>and </i>Code Quality</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Software Expert Kent Beck Presents a Catalog of Patterns Infinitely Useful for Everyday Programming</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Great code doesn&#x2019;t just function: it clearly and consistently communicates your intentions, allowing other programmers to understand your code, rely on it, and modify it with confidence. But great code doesn&#x2019;t just happen. It is the outcome of hundreds of small but critical decisions programmers make every single day. Now, legendary software innovator Kent Beck&#x2013;known worldwide for creating Extreme Programming and pioneering software patterns and test-driven development&#x2013;focuses on these critical decisions, unearthing powerful &#x201c;implementation patterns&#x201d; for writing programs that are simpler, clearer, better organized, and more cost effective. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Beck collects 77 patterns for handling everyday programming tasks and writing more readable code. This new collection of patterns addresses many aspects of development, including class, state, behavior, method, collections, frameworks, and more. He uses diagrams, stories, examples, and essays to engage the reader as he illuminates the patterns. You&#x2019;ll find proven solutions for handling everything from naming variables to checking exceptions. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This book covers</p> <ul> <li>The value of communicating through code and the philosophy behind patterns</li> <li>How and when to create classes, and how classes encode logic</li> <li>Best practices for storing and retrieving state</li> <li>Behavior: patterns for representing logic, including alternative paths</li> <li>Writing, naming, and decomposing methods</li> <li>Choosing and using collections</li> <li>Implementation pattern variations for use in building frameworks</li> </ul> <p> <b> <i>Implementation Patterns</i> </b> will help programmers at all experience levels, especially those who have benefited from software patterns or agile methods. It will also be an indispensable resource for development teams seeking to work together more efficiently and build more maintainable software. No other programming book will touch your day-to-day work more often. </p></p><p><b>Kent Beck, </b>one of the software industry&#x2019;s most creative and acclaimed leaders, consistently challenges software engineering dogma and promotes ideas like patterns, test-driven development, and Extreme Programming. Currently affiliated with Three Rivers Institute and Agitar Software, he is the author of many Addison-Wesley titles, including <i>Test-Driven Development</i> (2003) and, with Cynthia Andres, <i>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition</i> (2005).<p>This is a book about programming&#x2014;specifically, about programming so other people can understand your code. There is no magic to writing code other people can read. It&#x2019;s like all writing&#x2014;know your audience, have a clear overall structure in mind, express the details so they contribute to the whole story. Java offers some good ways to communicate. The implementation patterns here are Java programming habits that result in readable code.</p> <p>Another way to look at implementation patterns is as a way of thinking &#x201c;What do I want to tell a reader about this code?&#x201d; Programmers spend so much of their time in their own heads that trying to look at the world from someone else&#x2019;s viewpoint is a big shift. Not just &#x201c;What will the computer do with this code?&#x201d; but &#x201c;How can I communicate what I am thinking to people?&#x201d; This shift in perspective is healthy and potentially profitable, since so much software development money is spent on understanding existing code.</p> <p>There is an American game show called Jeopardy in which the host supplies answers and the contestants try to guess the questions. &#x201c;A word describing being thrown through a window.&#x201d; &#x201c;What is &#x2018;defenestration&#x2019;?&#x201d; &#x201c;Correct.&#x201d;</p> <p>Coding is like Jeopardy. Java provides answers in the form of its basic constructs. Programmers usually have to figure out for themselves what the questions are, what problems are solved by each language construct. If the answer is &#x201c;Declare a field as a Set.&#x201d; the question might be &#x201c;How can I tell other programmers that a collection contains no duplicates?&#x201d; The implementation patterns provide a catalog of the common problems in programming and the features of Java that address those problems.</p> <p>Scope management is as important in book writing as it is in software development. Here are some things this book is not. It is not a style guide because it contains too much explanation and leaves the final decisions up to the reader. It is not a design book because it is mostly concerned with smaller-scale decisions, the kind programmers make many times a day. It&#x2019;s not a patterns book because the format of the patterns is idiosyncratic and <i>ad hoc</i> (literally &#x201c;built for a particular purpose&#x201d;). It&#x2019;s not a language book because, while it covers many Java language features, it assumes readers already know Java.</p> <p>Actually this book is built on a rather fragile premise: that good code matters. I have seen too much ugly code make too much money to believe that quality of code is either necessary or sufficient for commercial success or widespread use. However, I still believe that quality of code matters even if it doesn&#x2019;t provide control over the future. Businesses that are able to develop and release with confidence, shift direction in response to opportunities and competition, and maintain positive morale through challenges and setbacks will tend to be more successful than businesses with shoddy, buggy code.</p> <p>Even if there was no long-term economic impact from careful coding I would still choose to write the best code I could. A seventy-year lifespan contains just over two billion seconds. That&#x2019;s not enough seconds to waste on work I&#x2019;m not proud of. Coding well is satisfying, both the act itself and the knowledge that others will be able to understand, appreciate, use, and extend my work.</p> <p>In the end, then, this is a book about responsibility. As a programmer you have been given time, talent, money, and opportunity. What will you do to make responsible use of these gifts? The pages that follow contain my answer to this question for me: code for others as well as myself and my buddy the CPU.</p></p><h2>The French Revolution and Napoleon: Crucible of the Modern World</h2><p><p>Lynn Hunt and Jack R.

Luminaries including Brian Kernighan, David Korn and Henry Spencer contribute to the book.</p><p>Unix ranks among the great engineering accomplishments of the last half of the twentieth century, and its heir--Linux--seems already imposing and still on its way to achieving its full potential. Eric S. Raymond argues in <i>The Art of UNIX Programming</i> that the excellence of Unix derives as much from the fact that it was (and continues to be) a community effort as from the fact that a lot of smart people have worked to design and build it. Raymond, best known as the author of the open-source manifesto <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i>, says in his preface that this is a "why-to" book, rather than a "how-to" book. It aims to show new Unix programmers why they should work under the old "hacker ethic"--embracing the principles of good software design for its own sake and of code-sharing. <p> That said, a great deal of valuable practical information appears in this book. Very little of it is in the form of code; most of the practical material takes the form of case studies and discussions of aspects of Unix, all aimed at determining why particular design characteristics are good. In many cases, the people who did the work in the first place make guest appearances and explain their thinking--an invaluable resource. This book is for the deep-thinking software developer in Unix (and perhaps Linux in particular). It shows how to fit into the long and noble tradition, and how to make the software work <i>right</i>. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Why Unix (the term being defined to include Linux) is the way it is, and the people who made it that way. Commentary from Ken Thompson, Steve Johnson, Brian Kernighan, and David Korn enables readers to understand the thought processes of the creators of Unix.</p><p> <i>"Reading this book has filled a gap in my education. I feel a sense of completion, understand that UNIX is really a style of community. Now I get it, at least I get it one level deeper than I ever did before. This book came at a perfect moment for me, a moment when I shifted from visualizing programs as things to programs as the shadows cast by communities. From this perspective, Eric makes UNIX make perfect sense."</i> <br> --Kent Beck, author of <i>Extreme Programming Explained, Test Driven Development</i>, and <i>Contributing to Eclipse</i> </p> <p> <i>"A delightful, fascinating read, and the lessons in problem-solvng are essential to every programmer, on any OS."</i> <br> --Bruce Eckel, author of <i>Thinking in Java</i> and<i> Thinking in C++</i> </p> <p> <b>Writing better software: 30 years of UNIX development wisdom</b> </p> <p>In this book, five years in the making, the author encapsulates three decades of unwritten, hard-won software engineering wisdom. Raymond brings together for the first time the philosophy, design patterns, tools, culture, and traditions that make UNIX home to the world's best and most innovative software, and shows how these are carried forward in Linux and today's open-source movement. Using examples from leading open-source projects, he shows UNIX and Linux programmers how to apply this wisdom in building software that's more elegant, more portable, more reusable, and longer-lived.</p> <p> <b>Raymond incorporates commentary from thirteen UNIX pioneers:</b> </p> <p> </p><ul> <li> <b>Ken Thompson</b>, the inventor of UNIX.</li> <li> <b>Ken Arnold</b>, part of the group that created the 4BSD UNIX releases and co-author of <i>The Java Programming Language</i>.</li> <li> <b>Steven M.

Under the principle that learning is most effective when it is both challenging and fun, the book includes numerous courtroom-based problems, both to facilitate the students' theoretical understanding of the rules and to develop their ability to apply evidence rules in practice. A number of problems are based on scenarios drawn from films and TV shows, so instructors can show video clips in conjunction with the problems. <i>Evidence Law and Practice</i> consistently provides examples, practice hints, explanations, and illustrations in the form of mini-transcripts. Each chapter begins with a checklist of important questions to be addressed for each subject area, followed by the pertinent provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence, a subject overview, illustrations, examples, and problems. While appellate court opinions are not the primary text of this book, the ways that judges discuss evidence rules are important and a useful basis for classroom discussions. Consequently, many chapters provide summarized versions of relevant opinions. Features of the Seventh Edition include: An expanded Appendix 2, which sets forth California Evidence Code provisions that differ in significant ways from the Federal Rules of Evidence and provide comparative approaches to evidence rule-making; An expansion of Chapter 19, which consists primarily of multiple-choice questions (and answers). Because many Evidence examinations include multiple-choice questions, the revised version of Chapter 19 will be especially helpful to students; Chapter 5 (Character Evidence), Chapter 8 (Lay Witness Opinions), and Chapter 9 (Expert Witnesses) have been completely rewritten under the leadership of Dustin Benham, the books new co-author; A brand new Chapter 20, which presents evidentiary review exercises in the form of excerpts from actual historically significant trials. The cases from which the excerpts are taken include the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the O.J. Simpson trial, the Menendez Brothers trial, and the trial of <i>Anderson v. W.R. Grace</i>, the subject of the film <i>A Civil Action</i>. Analyses of the questions embedded in these transcripts are in the Teachers Manual.</p><p>Steven Friedland is a Professor of Law at Elon University School of Law.

Second wave AI, machine learning, even visions of third-wave AI: none will lead to human-level intelligence and judgment, which have been honed over millennia. Recent advances in AI may be of epochal significance, but human intelligence is of a different order than even the most powerful calculative ability enabled by new computational capacities. Smith calls this AI ability &#x201c;reckoning,&#x201d; and argues that it does not lead to full human judgment&#x2015;dispassionate, deliberative thought grounded in ethical commitment and responsible action.<br><br>Taking judgment as the ultimate goal of intelligence, Smith examines the history of AI from its first-wave origins (&#x201c;good old-fashioned AI,&#x201d; or GOFAI) to such celebrated second-wave approaches as machine learning, paying particular attention to recent advances that have led to excitement, anxiety, and debate.

These are the same practice tests offered at the REA Study Center, but without the added benefits of timed testing conditions and diagnostic score reports. Because the actual exam is computer-based, we recommend you take at least one practice test online to simulate test-day conditions.<p></p><b> AN OVERVIEW OF THE EXAM<br></b>The CLEP Analyzing and Interpreting Literature exam consists of approximately 80 multiple-choice questions, each with five possible answer choices, to be answered in two separately timed 45-minute sections. The exam covers the material one would find in a two-semester college-level course. The examinee is assumed to have an extensive background in the areas of prose, poetry, and drama, but knowledge of specifc works is not required.<p></p> The Analyzing and Interpreting Literature exam is divided into the following percentages:<p></p> 35&#x2013;45% Poetry<p></p> 35&#x2013;45% Prose (fiction and nonfiction)<p></p> 15&#x2013;30% Drama<p></p> The three forms of literary expression are broken down as follows:<p></p> 30&#x2013;45% American Literature<p></p> 50&#x2013;65% British Literature<p></p> 5&#x2013;15% Works in Translation<p></p> The above areas are further broken down into these time periods:<p></p> 3&#x2013;7% Classical and Pre-Renaissance<p></p> 20&#x2013;30% Renaissance and Seventeenth Century<p></p> 35&#x2013;45% Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries<p></p> 25&#x2013;35% Twentieth Century<p></p> Some colleges may require candidates to take an essay section in addition to the multiple-choice section. The essay section is comprised of two 45-minute questions. One question requires candidates to analyze a short poem and the other question requires the test-taker to apply a generalization about literature to a novel, short story, or a play that they have read. The essay section is administered in paper-and-pencil format and is graded by the institution, not the College Board.<p></p><b> ALL ABOUT THE CLEP PROGRAM<br>What is the CLEP?<br></b>The College-Level Examination Program is the most widely accepted credit-by-examination program in North America. CLEP exams are now available in 33 subjects and test the material commonly required in an introductory-level college course. Examinees can earn from three to twelve credits at more than 2,900 colleges and universities in the U.S. and Canada. For a complete list of the CLEP subject examinations offered, visit the College Board website: <i>www.collegeboard.org/clep</i>.<p></p><b> Who takes CLEP exams?<br></b>CLEP exams are typically taken by people who have acquired knowledge outside the classroom and who wish to bypass certain college courses and earn college credit. The CLEP program is designed to reward examinees for learning&#x2014;no matter where or how that knowledge was acquired.<p></p> Although most CLEP examinees are adults returning to college, many graduating high school seniors, enrolled college students, military personnel, veterans, and international students take CLEP exams to earn college credit or to demonstrate their ability to perform at the college level. There are no prerequisites, such as age or educational status, for taking CLEP examinations.<p></p> However, because policies on granting credits vary among colleges, you should contact the particular institution from which you wish to receive CLEP credit.<p></p><b> Who administers the exam?<br></b>CLEP exams are developed by the College Board, administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS), and involve the assistance of educators from throughout the United States. The test development process is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate.<p></p><b> When and where is the exam given?<br></b>CLEP exams are administered year-round at more than 1,200 test centers in the United States and can be arranged for candidates abroad on request. To find the test center nearest you and to register for the exam, contact the CLEP Program:<p></p> CLEP Services<br>P.O.

All the CLEP exams are available at test centers on college campuses and military bases. Contact your Educational Services Officer or Navy College Education Specialist for more information. Visit the DANTES or College Board websites for details about CLEP opportunities for military personnel.<p></p> Eligible U.S. veterans can claim reimbursement for CLEP exams and administration fees pursuant to provisions of the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004. For details on eligibility and submitting a claim for reimbursement, visit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website at <i>www.gibill.va.gov/pamphlets/testing.htm</i><p></p> CLEP can be used in conjunction with the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which applies to veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of operation. Because the GI Bill provides tuition for up to 36 months, earning college credits with CLEP exams expedites academic progress and degree completion within the funded timeframe.<p></p><b> SSD ACCOMMODATIONS FOR CANDIDATES WITH DISABILITIES<br></b>Many test candidates qualify for extra time to take the CLEP exams, but you must make these arrangements in advance.

Carolyn Burke, a biographer and art critic, here reveals how the muse who inspired Man Ray, Cocteau, and Picasso could be the same person who unflinchingly photographed the horrors of Buchenwald and Dachau. Burke captures all the verve and energy of Miller&#x2019;s life: from her early childhood trauma to her stint as a <i>Vogue</i> model and art-world ing�nue, from her harrowing years as a war correspondent to her unconventional marriages and passion for gourmet cooking. A lavishly illustrated story of art and beauty, sex and power, Modernism and Surrealism, <i>Lee Miller</i> illuminates an astonishing woman&#x2019;s journey from art object to artist.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Carolyn Burke</b> has taught at Princeton and the University of California at Santa Cruz, among other universities in France, the U.S., and Australia. She is the author of <i>Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy.</i><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><b>A Poughkeepsie Girlhood<br><br>(1907&#x2013;15)<br></b><br>On April 23, 1907, Theodore Miller entered the birth of his daughter, Elizabeth, in his diary, noting the time of day (4:15 p.m.), the place (the Miller home, 40 South Clinton Street, Poughkeepsie, New York), her weight (seven pounds), and the names of those in attendance (Dr. Gribbon and Nurse Ferguson). His firstborn, Elizabeth&#x2019;s brother John, had come into the world two years earlier, but the little girl&#x2014;Li Li, then Te Te, Bettie, and in her twentieth year, Lee&#x2014;would always be her father&#x2019;s favorite. Her blue eyes and blond curls enchanted him. Whatever name she went by, she was his Elizabeth, whose growth he would continue to document, one might almost say obsessively.<br><br>By the time Elizabeth was born, Theodore Miller was the superintendent of Poughkeepsie&#x2019;s largest employer, the DeLaval Separator Company (its machines separated heavier liquids from lighter ones). An ambitious man of thirty-five who was on his way to becoming one of the town&#x2019;s elite, he had married three years earlier after securing his position at DeLaval&#x2019;s recently enlarged plant on the bank of the Hudson River. Florence Miller, his wife, is not mentioned in the diary entry, as if her part in the arrival of their daughter could not be reckoned among the facts and figures that gave him his grip on the world. Perhaps it was taken for granted. Like most men of his time, Theodore believed that a woman&#x2019;s place was at home, a man&#x2019;s with the new world of science and technology&#x2014;the forces that enabled entrepreneurs like himself and the country as a whole to move forward.<br><br>Theodore always said that he came of a long line of mechanics. A tall, erect man with penetrating blue eyes, he might have stepped out of a Horatio Alger novel. Born in 1872 in the aptly named Mechanicsville, Ohio, he grew up in Richmond, Indiana, at that time the largest Quaker settlement in the country. Although the Millers were not Quakers, he thought well of this sect despite his opposition to formal religion and, in adulthood, his atheism. More important to him than the Society of Friends and the Inner Light were facts. As a youth he had worked in a roller-skate-wheel factory, then a machine shop where he operated lathes. Earning his qualification in mechanical engineering through a correspondence course reinforced the idea that hard work led not only to self-improvement but also to material rewards.<br><br>When telling his children about his rise in the world, Theodore emphasized the Miller self-reliance. His ancestors included Hessian mercenaries who had fought for the British in the Revolutionary War; his father was famous as the man who laid seven thousand bricks a day when helping to build Antioch College; his older brother, Fred, was an engineer widely known as the editor of the <i>American Machinist</i>. Theodore&#x2019;s career illustrated the belief that a self-confident man could try his hand at anything. In his twenties he had worked in New Jersey at a U.S. Navy shipyard, in Brooklyn at a typewriter factory, in Mexico at the Monterrey Steel Works, and in Utica, New York, at the Drop Forge and Tool Company, where he became general manager. So intent upon making his way that he did not think about marriage until he turned thirty, he then proposed to Florence MacDonald, the fair-haired Canadian nurse who had cared for him during his treatment for typhoid at Utica Hospital.<br><br>It was typical of their union that the children heard more about the Millers than about the MacDonalds. Florence told them little of her background except that her people were Scots-Irish settlers from Brockville, Ontario, where she was born in 1881, and that her parents had died when she was a girl, after which she went to live with relatives. Only later did they learn that the MacDonalds had been defeated by their hard, rocky land, and that Florence had had little education apart from nurse&#x2019;s training. Then, nursing was one of the few paths open to women from poor families. There were more opportunities in the United States than at home but the work required dedication. Florence would have earned little more than room and board at the training hospital in Utica&#x2014;except for the hope that once certified, she could work anywhere. Theodore Miller may have won her heart, but he was also a good catch.<br><br>Their life together as members of Poughkeepsie&#x2019;s bourgeoisie began when they married in 1904, after he had settled into his position at DeLaval. It would have required an adjustment on Florence&#x2019;s part to manage a household staffed with servants, including some from the town&#x2019;s black community. In the few family photographs taken before 1904 Florence is a shy, slender young woman. She was happy to trade her white cap and nurse&#x2019;s uniform for the large-brimmed hats and flowing gowns of the 1900s, to collect bric-a-brac for her new house, and in time, once her children were at school, to educate herself.<br><br>Although Florence took her turn giving the tea parties expected of the Poughkeepsie ladies with whom she mingled, some insecurity prevented her from enjoying these occasions. She fussed about details. Unsure which of Poughkeepsie&#x2019;s many Protestant churches to attend, she tried them all. Traces of her time as a nurse were still discernible in her bathroom, where white tiles and a doctor&#x2019;s scale implied that cleanliness was next to godliness. Florence retained a horror of germs and a reverence for doctors. She was also in awe of her husband, who was nearly ten years older and the mainstay of their comfortable life.<br><br>The Millers often told their children a story from their early days in Poughkeepsie. Because of Theodore&#x2019;s position, the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution invited his bride to join this ultraconservative organization. Florence filled in the genealogical forms required of new members. Her husband&#x2019;s Hessian forebears, who had fought against the revolution that gave the group its name, raised a few eyebrows, but as soon as the membership committee saw that she was Canadian, the invitation was withdrawn. Having been treated as less than loyal Americans, the Millers turned the incident into a joke. And since it was impossible to infiltrate the old families whose cupolaed mansions overlooked the Hudson, they made the best of the matter by establishing themselves as citizens of the new century.<br>Depending upon whom you were talking to, Poughkeepsie in the 1900s was either a declining regional capital or an industrial center ready to take advantage of its strategic location. Both accounts were accurate. To the town&#x2019;s more progressive citizens, its values seemed Victorian. Yet at the same time, institutions like Vassar College&#x2014;located two miles east of town&#x2014;were trying out new ideas about women&#x2019;s social and intellectual potential, and forward-looking businesses like DeLaval, a Swedish firm, were rethinking the relations between civic and professional life. Many Poughkeepsians believed they lived at the center of things. The New York Central&#x2019;s trains sped north along the Hudson to Albany and south to New York City, the bridge across the river encouraged trips west to New Paltz and the Catskills, the Dutchess Turnpike ran east past rich farmlands to Connecticut.<br><br>Since the eighteenth century, the &#x201c;river families,&#x201d; the old guard of Dutchess County, had looked down from their hilltop estates on the villages along the Hudson&#x2019;s shores as if they were the fiefs in some American version of feudalism. Poughkeepsie, a town of twenty-four thousand when Elizabeth was born, had always been something of an exception. Its inhabitants prided themselves on their town&#x2019;s history as a seventeenth-century Dutch settlement and an early state capital, the site of New York&#x2019;s ratification convention for the U.S. Constitution, and from the 1860s on, the hub of swift railroad connections to the north and west. Although the symbol of the new century, the Twentieth Century Limited, flew past Poughkeepsie on its way from New York to Chicago, the city&#x2019;s position halfway between New York and Albany was thought to ensure its influence&#x2014;provided the town fathers could agree on what was meant by progress and how to go about implementing it.<br><br>Prominent Poughkeepsians looked to technology as the way to be &#x201c;up-to-date.&#x201d; At a time when civic leaders all over the United States indulged in boosterism to enhance their town&#x2019;s reputation at the expense of neighboring ones, they proclaimed Poughkeepsie&#x2019;s superiority over its rivals, Syracuse and Albany. Yet in reality it had grown very little since the 1870s, a number of businesses having failed or gone elsewhere. Industries clustered along the Hudson in former times had included shipbuilders, dye mills, a brewery, and an ironworks, many of which had been replaced by larger, more modern concerns like DeLaval and Queen Undermuslins, a manufacturer of women&#x2019;s underwear. What was good for these businesses was good for Poughkeepsie, town officials said, as were recent municipal gains like electric lights, telephones, and macadam paving. But there were those who said that they had been right to decline Thomas Edison&#x2019;s offer to make Poughkeepsie the first fully electrified American city, after which he bestowed the honor upon Newburgh.<br><br>In Theodore Miller&#x2019;s espousal of modern technology, he spoke for the &#x201c;progressives,&#x201d; those who favored any and all improvements.

And the balance between markets and government; free enterprise and social protection is perennially in question. But all developed societies have welfare states of one kind or another - they are a fundamental dimension of modern government. And even after decades of free-market criticism and reform, their core institutions have proven resilient and popular. <br><br>This <em>Very Short Introduction </em>describes the modern welfare state, explaining its historical and contemporary significance and arguing that far from being 'a failure' or 'a problem', welfare states are an essential element of contemporary capitalism, and a vital concomitant of democratic government. In this accessible and entertaining account, David Garland cuts through the fog of misunderstandings to explain in clear and simple terms, what welfare states are, how they work, and why they matter.<br><br>ABOUT THE SERIES: The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Art. Andrew Romanoff is the grandnephew of the late Tsar Nicholas Romanoff. Had the Bolshevik Revolution not intervened, Andrew himself was in line to become Tsar of Russia. Instead, he grew up in exile on the grounds at Windsor Castle in London. Prince Andrew, now 85 years old, chronicles his remarkable childhood in THE BOY WHO WOULD BE TSAR, THE ART OF PRINCE ANDREW ROMANOFF. Prince Andrew&#39;s drawings of daily life are executed on Shrinky Dink material, a plastic which shrinks when heated in the oven. His decidedly original works are rooted in the realm of Folk Art. He uses these drawings to illustrate the story of his childhood at Frogmore Cottage, a thirty six room mansion on the grounds of Windsor. There, Andrew was raised with his parents and grandmother Grand Duchess Xenia.</p><p>He was born in London, United Kingdom, the youngest child of Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia (1897-1981) and his first wife Elisabetha Sasso-Ruffo (1886-1940). Prince Andrew is a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia and as such he is a grandnephew of Russia&#39;s last reigning Emperor, Nicholas II. His godfather was Edward VIII of the United Kingdom. He spent his childhood living in a guesthouse at Windsor Castle. Prince Andrew was educated at the Imperial Service College and served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War. In 1949, he left Britain for the United States where he worked for a time as a carpenter. He became a naturalised US citizen on December 20, 1954. He currently resides in Marin County, California, and has written the autobiography, The Boy Who Would Be Tsar, which is illustrated with his artwork.INVERNESS, Calif. - If history hadn't gotten in the way, Andrew Romanoff could have been the emperor of Russia. But as things turned out, the mustachioed grandnephew of the ill-fated last czar spends his time painting whimsical, folk-art renderings of his unusual upbringing in a dethroned royal family onto "Shrinky Dinks," the plastic children's toy that shrinks in the oven. His whimsical pieces, which chronicle daily life, are currently being shown at a gallery in San Francisco. Along with his recent memoir, "The Boy Who Would be Tsar: The Art of Prince Andrew Romanoff," they tell the story of the 20th century's great wars and political convulsions from the very intimate perspective of a child at the center of it all. "At certain moments I would be called on to play the game, be a prince," said Romanoff, 84, recalling the family reunion in St. Petersburg in 1998, when the last Czar of Russia, Nicholas II, and his family were reburied 80 years after their execution by Bolshevik revolutionaries. "But it's always the people around me who get excited about it." His art addresses the public's curiosity about his royal birth. But in the context of Romanoff's life, this attention to his origins seems almost an afterthought, as he has shunned notoriety most of his life. Art covers the walls of their redwood-shingled house in Inverness, a tiny waterfront town on the edge of Point Reyes National Seashore. There is folk art, their own art, pieces by friends and by well-known artists, and family photos. The vibrant display makes it clear that Romanoff's royal birth was only the first of many quirky twists in a full, eventful life. The story begins a few years before Romanoff was born, with the Russian Revolution of 1917 - a turning point in the history of the world, and for the Romanoff family, which had held the Russian throne since 1613. The Bolshevik triumph led to the murder of Nicholas II, his wife and children, and plunged Russia into decades of communist rule. N --Associated Press:JULIANA BARBASSA<br><br>Review : Andrew Romanoff: The Boy Who Would Be Tsar Russian Prince, Andrew Romanoff spent his childhood living in a Windsor Castle guesthouse and once mistakenly ate some chocolate Easter eggs meant for a certain princess named Elizabeth. He could have been Russia's last Tsar, but instead he fought in World War II and moved to Palo Alto in 1949. And he illustrates his life on Shrinky Dinks. Clear plastic sheets that shrink when baked in an oven, Shrinky Dinks were a memorable art project for those who grew up in the '70s and '80s. The Shrinky Dinks I remember had printed pictures of Smurfs that we'd fill in with colored pencil, then shrink and place on little plastic stands to create 2-D figures that would be played with for three seconds and then lost in the bottom of your toy pile. Romanoff uses this whimsical medium along with colored pencil and paint to illustrate a privileged and isolated childhood and a tumultuous early adult life. His family fled Russia during the Bolshevik revolution after his great uncle, Tsar Nicholas II and other relatives were murdered. England's King George was the Tsar's cousin and sent for Romanoff's family to offer them a safe haven. Though he was born in England and Queen Mary was "Auntie Mary" to Prince Romanoff, he was not often encouraged to socialize with the Royals. However, he was once invited to a party where the children were instructed to let Princess Elizabeth win a game because it was her birthday. I had to remind myself that this was not make-believe, but a true story about the current, real-life Queen of England. Romanoff, who now lives in the coastal town of Inverness, California, presents his memories in a narrative format. They are not all grand, just specially selected random autobiographical moments. Though his childlike drawings are not profoundly technical, they are very sweet and have a pleasing use of bright, Crayola color. Under each illustration is a description written on a separate piece of Shrinky Dink.

Now, recent economic crises have made it imperative for us to comprehend and actualize Marx&#x2019;s ideas. But without a knowledge of Karl Marx&#x2019;s life as he lived it, neither Marx nor his works can be fully understood. There are more than twenty-five comprehensive biographies of Marx, but none of them consider his life and work in equal, corresponding measure. This biography, planned for three volumes, aims to include what most biographies have reduced to mere background: the contemporary conflicts, struggles, and disputes that engaged Marx at the time of his writings, alongside his complex relationships with a varied assortment of friends and opponents. </p><p>This first volume will deal extensively with Marx&#x2019;s youth in Trier and his studies in Bonn and Berlin. It will also examine the function of poetry in his intellectual development and his first occupation with Hegelian philosophy and with the so-called &#x201c;young Hegelians&#x201d; in his 1841 Dissertation. Already during this period, there were crises as well as breaks in Marx&#x2019;s intellectual development that prompted Marx to give up projects and re-conceptualize his critical enterprise. This volume is the beginning of an astoundingly dimensional look at Karl Marx &#x2013; a study of a complex life and body of work through the neglected issues, events, and people that helped comprise both. It is destined to become a classic.</p></p><p><b>Michael Heinrich</b> taught economics for many years at the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin and was managing editor of PROKLA: Journal for Critical Social Science.

In the first full account of Dadd's life and career, the author examines Dadd's artistic legacy and uses his case to investigate the encounter between art and the treatment of mental illness in the nineteenth century. In the enclosed world of the asylum, Dadd's doctors were both his custodians and his patrons, while the legends of modern medicine became part of the larger mythological systems that informed the artist's work. </p><p>In the summer of 1842, Richard Dadd was the resident artist for an English expedition through Greece, Turkey and Egypt. Towards the trip's end, Dadd underwent a dramatic personality change, believing himself to be under the command of the god Osiris. Upon his return to England, he was diagnosed &#x201c;of unsound mind&#x201d; and was taken by his family to recuperate in Cobham, Kent. It was here, in August 1843, that Dadd murdered his father, before fleeing to France where he was eventually captured and committed to Bedlam psychiatric hospital in London. Over the next 40 years, Dadd made some of Victorian Britain's most mesmerizing paintings, such as his endlessly detailed masterpiece, &#x201c;The Fairy Feller's Masterstroke&#x201d; &#x2014; a proto-psychedelic fairy drama whose fame in the 1960s and 70s prompted the rock band Queen to record a song about it, and which remains one of Tate Britain's most visited paintings. The tale of the rediscovery of Dadd's greatest watercolor, &#x201c;The Artist's Halt in the Desert,&#x201d; on <em>The Antiques Roadshow</em> in 1987 has also entered popular folklore. <em>Richard Dadd: The Artist and the Asylum</em> is the first thorough monograph on this neglected Victorian virtuoso. Alongside its 100 color plates, critical essays overturn several myths about Dadd (revealing, for example, that his jailers were generous and often acted as his patrons rather than as his oppressors) and trace the critical reception of his now widely admired art.</p><p><strong>Richard Dadd</strong> (1817-1886) was born in Chatham, Kent, and entered The Royal Academy at the age of 20. In 1842, Sir Thomas Phillips chose Dadd to accompany him as his draftsman on an expedition to the Middle East, during which the first signs of the artist's schizophrenia emerged. Following his murder of his father in 1843, Dadd was incarcerated in Bedlam hospital, later being moved to Broadmoor, where he died in 1886.</p></p><p>In this elegantly written and scholarly book, Tromans, a historian of 19th century British Art, avoids all stereotypes and very sensibly keeps his eye on the sociological and historical context. (John Dorfman <i>Art &amp; Antiques</i>)<br><br>Tromans's readings of the paintings are subtle and astute, but what really distinguishes his book is the close attention paid to the relationship between the artist and his minders ... Richard Dadd: The Artist and the Asylum is a troubling feast for the eye. (Robert Irwin <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>It is the first comprehensive, illustrated biography since the Tate Gallery's 1974 exhibition catalogue and it looks at the life of an artist who was painting surrealist imagery and alternative worlds, including dream figrues, fairy figures and demons.

Since the start of the war in Iraq, Marines like Major Steve Beck found themselves charged with a mission they never asked for and one for which there can be no training: casualty notification. In <i>Final Salute</i>, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jim Sheeler weaves together the stories of the fallen, the broken homes they have left behind, and one man's effort to help heal the wounds of those left grieving. But it is not a book about war, politics, or liberal vs. conservative. Achingly beautiful and honest, it is a book that every American-every human-can embrace.</p><p><b>Jim Sheeler</b> is the Shirley Wormser Professor of Journalism and Media Writing at Case Western Reserve University. He is the author of a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning newspaper feature on the war in Iraq that led to a book, <i>Final Salute</i>, which was a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award in nonfiction.Jim Sheeler reports on the families of soldiers who have been killed in action, as well as the soldiers Stateside who tend to those families&#39; needs. Narrator Mark Deakins&#39;s sonorous start reflects the dread felt by Marine Major Steve Beck as he prepares to notify a family of its loss. Deakins gives depth to all the family portraits by giving his narration full emotional power, especially in the expressive quotes. Using a tone of respect, he voices family members&#39; motions of anger and sorrow, as well as their love for those killed. Individual portrayals, like the one of the pregnant widow who spends a last night with her husband&#39;s flag-draped coffin, communicate both the grief of the families and the dedication of the soldiers who accompany them on their difficult journeys.

Since September 11, this form of militarism has taken on new and unpredictable proportions. Diana Johnstone's well-documented study demonstrates that a crucial moment in establishing in the public mindand above all, within the political context of liberalism and the leftthe legitimacy of such interventions was the "humanitarian" bombing of the former Yugoslavia in 1999.</p> <p>In the course of the civil wars that led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, a complex history came to be presented as a morality play in which the parts were scripted to meet the moral needs of the capitalist West. The identification of Muslims as defenseless victims and Serbs as genocidal monsters inflamed fears and hatreds within Yugoslavia, and prepared the way for power to be shifted from the people of the region to such international agencies as NATO.</p> <p><b>Deceptions and Self-Deceptions</b>tests the popular myths against the reality of Yugoslav history. Johnstone identifies the common geopolitical interests running through such military interventions, and argues persuasively that they create problems rather than solving them. She shows that the "Kosovo war" was in reality the model for future destruction of countries seen as potential threats to the hegemony of an "international community" currently being redefined to exclude or marginalize all but those who conform to the interests of the United States.</p> <p>A concluding chapter shows how the script prepared for Yugoslavia is being re-enacted in Afghanistan. Whether Milosevic's trial before the International Court at the Hague or the capture of bin Laden will provide an adequate conclusion to this ideological play-making, remains an open question.</p></p><p><p><b>Diana Johnstone</b>is a distinguished researcher and commentator on contemporary global politics.

Born in India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.This is one of my all-time favorite books. Paramhansa Yogananda, who wrote the classic Autobiography of a Yogi, shares his inspiring poem-prayers as well as giving us advice about how to pray. Instead of begging, he says, we need to demand and explains why this is so. By following his advice, we can reach new heights in our understanding of God-Spirit as well as in our relationship to divinity.<br>There are prayers for everything from greeting the dawn and starting our day to prayers for wisdom, prosperity, balance, health, and relationships. This edition has been edited by one of Yogananda's disciples, Nayaswami Kriyananda, so that the words flow a bit better while still remaining true to the content of the original 1949 edition.<br>If you've been looking for a prayer book or one that might inspire you to higher thoughts, feelings, and actions, this is the one for you. It was written for people of all religions and beliefs and is dedicated to the "soul-temples of Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, Hebrews, Hindus, and others...."

The same guy. I spotted him from far away, some angle of his head or chin that made my stomach jump before I even realized who I was looking at. I made my way toward him around the acupuncturists, the herbal doctors slapping mustard-colored poultices on bloody wounds, and the vendors of the platform shoes and polyester bell-bottoms everyone in Kunming was mysteriously wearing. I was afraid he'd recognize me. Then it hit me that I'd still been beardless when he'd ripped me off, two years before, and my beard--according to old friends, who were uniformly staggered by the sight of me--had completely transformed (for the better, I kept waiting to hear) my appearance.We were the only two Westerners at this outdoor market, which was a long bike ride from my hotel and seedy in a way I couldn't pin down. The guy saw me coming. "Howdy," he said."Hello," I replied. It was definitely him. I always notice eyes, and his were a funny gray-green--bright, with long lashes like little kids have. He'd been wearing a suit when I met him, and a short ponytail, which at that particular moment signified hip Wall Street. One look and you saw the life: Jeep Wrangler, brand-new skis, fledgling art collection that, if he'd had balls enough to venture beyond Fischl and Schnabel and Basquiat, might have included a piece by my wife. He'd been the sort of New Yorker we San Franciscans are slightly in awe of. Now his hair was short, unevenly cut, and he wore some kind of woven jacket."You been here long?" I asked."Here where?""China.""Eight months," he said. "I work for the <i>China Times</i>."I stuffed my hands in my pockets, feeling weirdly self-conscious, like I was the one with something to hide. "You working on something now?""Drugs," he said."I thought there weren't any over here."He leaned toward me, half smiling. "You're standing in the heroin capital of China.""No shit," I said.He rolled on the balls of his feet. I knew it was time to bid polite farewell and move on, but I stayed where I was."You with a tour?" he finally asked."Just my wife and kids. We're trying to get a train to Chengdu, been waiting five days.""What's the problem?""Mei you," I said, quoting the ubiquitous Chinese term for "can't be done." But you never know what, or which factors, if changed, would make that "no" a "yes." "That's what the hotel people keep saying.""Fuck the hotel," he said.We stood a moment in silence, then he checked his watch. "Look, if you want to hang out a couple of minutes, I can probably get you those tickets," he said.He wandered off and said a few words to a lame Chinese albino crouched near a building alongside the market. China Times, I thought. Like hell. Heroin pusher was more like it. At the same time, there was an undeniable thrill in being near this guy. He was a crook--I knew it, but he had no idea I knew. I enjoyed having this over him; it almost made up for the twenty-five grand he'd conned out of me.We set off on our bicycles back toward the center of town. With Caroline and the girls I took taxis, which could mean anything from an automobile to a cart pulled by some thin, sweating guy on a bicycle. It pissed me off that the four of us couldn't ride bikes together like any other Chinese family. ("Since when are we a Chinese family, Sam?" was my wife's reply.) But the girls pleaded terror of falling off the bikes and getting crushed by the thick, clattering columns of riders, all ringing their tinny, useless bells. Secretly, I believed that what really turned my daughters off were the crummy black bikes the Chinese rode--such a far cry from the shiny five-and ten-speeds Melissa and Kylie had been reared on.In our previous encounter, his name had been Cameron Pierce. Now, as we rode, he introduced himself as Stuart Peale, shouting over the thunderous racket of passing trucks. The names fit him exactly, both times; Cameron had had the impatient, visionary air of a guy who thinks he can make you a shitload of money; Stuart was soft-spoken, a sharp observer--what you'd expect from a reporter. I told him my name--Sam Lafferty--half hoping he'd make the connection, but only when I named the company I traded for did I notice him pause for a second."I've taken a leave while they investigate me," I said, to my own astonishment."Investigate you for what?""Messing with the numbers." And unnerved though I was by what I'd revealed, I felt a mad urge to continue. "It's just internal at this point.""Wow," he said, giving me an odd look. "Good luck."We dismounted in front of a large concrete kiosk teeming with several lines of people all shoving and elbowing one another goodnaturedly toward a ticket counter in a manner I'd decided was uniquely Chinese. Stuart spoke to a uniformed official in vehement but (I sensed) broken Chinese, gesturing at me. At last the official led us grudgingly through a side door and down a dimly lit corridor that had the smudged, institutional feel of the public schools I'd attended as a kid and made sure my daughters would never go near."Where is it you're headed--Chengdu?" he called.We had entered a shabby office where a military-looking woman sat behind a desk, seeming thoroughly disgruntled at Stuart's intrusion. "Yes--for four people," I reminded him.Within minutes, I'd handed Stuart a wad of cash and he'd given me the tickets. We reemerged into the tepid, dusty sunlight. "You leave tomorrow," he said. "Eight-thirty A.M. They'd only sell me first class--hope that's okay.""It's fine." We always rode first class. So had Stuart, I guessed, in his prior incarnation. "Thank you," I said. "Jesus."He waved it away. "They don't want Americans having a lousy time over here," he said. "You point out that it's happening, they'll fix it."He handed me his card, the address in English and Chinese, the China Times logo neatly embossed. Still a pro, I thought."You live in Xi'an," I remarked. "We may go there, check out that clay army."Look me up," he said, clearly not meaning it. "Thanks again.""Forget it," he said, then mounted his bicycle and rode away."A total stranger?" my wife said, back in our hotel room, where I'd surprised her with the train tickets. "He just did this, for no reason?""He was American." I was dying to tell her he was the cocksucker who'd conned me, but how could I explain having hung out with the guy, having accepted a favor from him? I knew how Caroline would see it: one more incident in the string of odd things I'd been doing since the investigation began, the most recent of which was to beg my family to drop everything and come with me to China. It wasn't depression, exactly; more a weird, restless pressure that made me wander the house late at night, opening the best bottles of wine in our cellar and drinking them alone while I channel-surfed along the forgotten byways of cable TV."Where are the girls?" I said. "I got them each a little knife to peel pears with.""You bought them knives?""Just little ones," I said. "Have you noticed how the old ladies are always peeling pears? I've got a feeling there's something on those skins they shouldn't be eating."Caroline had washed her bras and underpants and was hanging them on the open dresser drawers to dry. In the late seventies, before we married, we'd spent a year in Kenya with the Peace Corps. Caroline washed her clothes the same way over there, hanging them on strings she tied across our tiny room. I used to watch her through the web of strings and underclothes--her reddish brown hair and deep, peaceful eyes that made me think of amber. I always liked remembering that time, knowing the money and houses and trips we'd gotten our hands on since hadn't washed it all away. We're still those people, I'd tell myself, who helped the Masai to repair their houses made of cow dung.Caroline opened a window, and instantly the sour, bodily smell of China poured into the room. "A perfect stranger," she mused, smiling at me. "Must've been that sweet face of yours."My daughters give me away. They are blond, expensive-looking creatures whose soft skin and upturned noses I used to take credit--wrongly, I know--for having procured for them at great cost, as I had their orthodontically perfect smiles. In Kenya the Masai children had dry lips and flies in their eyes. Memories of their deprivation had overwhelmed me in recent months, for reasons unknown. l'd find myself staring at my daughters accusingly, awaiting some acknowledgment from them of the brutal disparity between the Masai kids' lives and their own. Instead, I found in their beauty a righteousness that galled me. The Avenging Angels, I'd started calling them, which perplexed my wife.Not that my daughters were identical. They were ten and twelve years old, the younger one deeply in awe of the elder, Melissa, whose figure-skating prowess had lent her a kind of celebrity at their private grammar school. Melissa was also, the world seemed to agree, fractionally more lovely. Determined to correct this imbalance, I had lately become the fervid champion of Kylie, my youngest, a campaign my wife deplored and begged me to abandon. "Picking favorites is awful, Sam," she told me. "Melissa thinks you hate her.""The world picked. I'm just evening up the balance."But there was something heavy-handed in the sudden barrage of affection I lavished on Kylie. She rose to the occasion, gamely enduring our "special" trips to the zoo and the Exploratorium and Ocean Beach, where we stumped through the damp, heavy sand, both wishing (or I was, at least) that Melissa--whom I'd bluntly excluded, whose skating competitions I often pretended to doze through--were with us.But now their hatred of China, their deep resentment at having to spend the best part of their summer in a land where people blew their noses without Kleenex, had united Melissa and Kylie in steely mutiny against me. "Daddy, why?" had been their refrain from the moment the trip began: the boat from Hong Kong into Canton, the days of waiting for a plane to Kunming that, when it finally arrived, could not have inspired less confidence had we assembled it ourselves. "Why, Daddy?" With time the object of their query had grown more and more diffuse: Why here? Why any of this? They were asking the wrong man.The buildings of Chengdu were newer, and therefore less pleasing, than those of Kunming. I roamed the streets impatiently, my wife and listless daughters in tow. We drank green tea in a moist enclave beside a Buddhist temple. The fog smelled of chemicals. An Asian girl with strange pale-blue eyes kept staring at us. "Do you think she might be crazy, Dad?" Melissa asked."She's admiring your haircut."Melissa glanced at me, thinking I might be serious, then recognized the acid sarcasm that had become my preferred mode of speech with her of late."Probably had you for a dad," she muttered."Probably wasn't so lucky."My wife sighed. "She's blind," she said. And instantly I saw that Caroline was right; the girl was drawn by our unrecognizable voices, but her eyes were empty."Let's go to Xi'an," I said. "It's supposed to be fascinating."Melissa opened our guidebook, scanned the pages, and read aloud: "The Qin Terra-Cotta Warriors are one of the few reasons to visit Xi'an, an urban wasteland of uniform city blocks and Soviet style apartment buildings, but they are a compelling one."That's not what I heard," I said, suppressing an urge to knock the book out of her hands."Terra-cotta worriers?" Kylie said."Heard from who?" my wife asked."The guy who got us the train tickets.""They're thousands of clay soldiers as big as real men," Caroline explained to Kylie. "A paranoid Chinese emperor had them built underground to protect him after he died.""Neat," Kylie said.Caroline looked at me. "Let's go there.""Why?" Melissa asked, but no one answered.Looking downtrodden, Melissa wandered out first from the tea shop. As we followed her, I turned to glance behind me, and sure enough, the Asian girl with the pale-blue eyes was still gazing blindly after us.I knew--and Caroline knew--that since the investigation began, my status had slipped--or risen--from that of her husband and equal to that of a person she indulged. Gratitude and guilt played a part in this. I'd worked my ass off at the office for years while she puttered away in her sculpture studio. Then, three years ago, Caroline hit the jackpot, landing a piece in the Whitney Biennial. This led to more exhibits, one-person shows in several cities, including New York, and dozens of studio visits from thin, beautiful women and their sleek young husbands who smelled (like me, I suppose) of fresh cash, or from scrawny, perfumed old bats whose doddering mates brought to mind country houses and slobbering retrievers. Everything my wife had yet to sculpt for the next three years was already sold. We'd talked about my quitting, pursuing anthropology or social work like I'd always said I wanted to, or just relaxing, for Christ's sake. But our overhead was so high: the house in Presidio Terrace, the girls in private school heading toward college, skating lessons, riding lessons, piano lessons, tennis camp in the summers--I wanted them to have all of it, all of it and more, for the rest of their lives. Even Caroline's respectable income could not have begun to sustain it. Then let's change, she'd said. Let's scale back. But the idea filled me with dread; I wasn't a sculptor, I wasn't a painter, I wasn't a person who made things. What I'd busted my chops all these years to create was precisely the life we led now. If we tossed that away, what would have been the point?We were still chewing on this when I found out about the investigation. Its architect, the aptly named Jeffrey Fox, had been after my scalp for years because his wife, Sheila, was a ball-buster, whereas mine was lovely and terrific. He was always sniffing around Caroline's studio, and had bought three of her pieces the year before. "That little turd!" Caroline had shrieked when I told her about the investigation, and night after night we'd sat awake long after the girls were in bed, holding whispered conferences on how I should respond: Write a letter to the board proclaiming my innocence? Mount a counteroffensive against Fox? But no, we decided. The best thing to do, for the moment, was nothing. Let the investigation run its course, and when it turned up nada, question the legitimacy of its having been started at all. In the meantime, take a leave, clear my head, get some sleep.

Parents and autism physicians around the world are using <em>Nourishing Hope for Autism</em> to guide their nutrition/diet focused interventions that help bring about real recovery results---improvement in cognitive ability, physical pain, digestive problems, rashes, speech, eye contact and aggression.<br><br>This book is a must have reference for autism diet success.</p><p><b>PREFACE OF NOURISHING HOPE:</b>Since I began my professional studies in holistic nutrition and biochemistry, I have been particularly fascinated with nutrition for human development--that is, nutrition for children. From the onset, I investigated how artificial ingredients, low nutrient foods, and sugars were implicated in a wide range of newly epidemic disorders in children, particularly ADHD, type 2 diabetes ("adult-onset"), heart disease, and even autism. <br><br>Once I discovered that imbalanced biochemical pathways influence the symptoms of ADHD and autism and that food, nutrition, and proper supplementation can have significant impact on these disorders, I was drawn to learn and understand more. There are many people striving to help these children: parents, doctors, caregivers, educators, therapists, advocacy groups, nutritionists, researchers and research groups. If all of these people could better comprehend these factors and influences, we could use our collective knowledge to better help these children and their families. As I researched important subjects such as liver function, endocrine imbalance, the immune system, and food sensitivities, I would always ask the question, "How is this implicated in autism spectrum disorders, and how do we impact it through nutritional or supplemental interventions?"<br><i><br>Nourishing Hope</i> is the culmination of seven years of research into and clinical experience with autism spectrum disorder and the affects of nutrition, environmental factors, and biochemical imbalances on these conditions. In this time, I have consulted with hundreds with children on the spectrum, read countless books and research papers, routinely attended (and now present at) leading conferences on the subject, interviewed leading-edge researchers, and collaborated with dozens of doctors and their patients. My work continues steadfastly. I consult with parents and physicians through my office in San Francisco, and clients across the world by telephone. I am driven to share what I have learned and continue to learn. We all must share what we know so that all children on the spectrum and their families may harvest the life-bringing energies of hope. I believe that all people are worthy of (and deserve) hope--it is an inherently human capacity that, when nourished always leads to some positive outcome. <br><br><b>To Parents: </b>I hope this book will educate and empower your active role in choosing and co-creating with your health care practitioner the best path for your child. While we all need help and guidance, decisions regarding the direction to take with your child's health are uniquely personal. There is new, changing, and controversial information and only you can decide what directions you are willing to go. My desire is that this book will assist you in discussing information and strategizing approaches with your healthcare practitioners. It is for you, the courageous parents, and your children, that I press on in search of answers and more ways to help. <br><br><b>To Doctors:</b> I hope this book will inform you, your practice, and your efforts to help these children. You who are diligently on the front lines with these kids, their parents, and the many institutions trying both discover what is going on, and how to best provide help. I honor your work and intend to serve as best I can the continually emerging body of knowledge and practice that nourishes hope for parents, practitioners, and the children we love. <br><br><b>To Nutrition and Holistic Colleagues:</b>I hope this book inspires interest in applying your knowledge of health and healing in even broader ways. We are in this together. There are many children and families out there who need our help. May this book (and my experience and research) help further your work. Your experience, thoughts, and suggestions are welcome.<br><br> Please feel free to write to me: I am also open to your feedback on where to clarify, add, or correct information. Thank you for your support. I wish you all the best on this path to healing. <br><br>My desire is that this book will help you physically nourish yourselves and your children toward health, and nourish hope within you that there is a way, there is a path to healing. <br><br>Julie Matthews<p>Julie Matthews is an internationally respected Certified Nutrition Consultant specializing in autism spectrum disorder.

Alongside classics by Margery Allingham, Anthony Berkeley and Thomas Burke are excellent and unusual stories by authors who are far less well known. The stories give a flavour of how writers have tackled crime in London over the span of more than half a century. Their contributions range from an early serial-killer thriller set on the London Underground and horrific vignettes to cerebral whodunits. What they have in common is an atmospheric London setting, and enduring value as entertainment.</p><p>Each story is introduced by the editor, Martin Edwards, who sheds light on the authors' lives and the background to their writing.</p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District.

If the world of nature needs a designer, they ask, then why wouldn't the designer itself need a designer, too? Or if it can exist without any designer behind it, then why can't we just say the same for the universe and wash our hands of a designer altogether?</p><p>Interweaving its pursuit of the First Cause with personal stories and humor, this ground-breaking book takes a fresh approach to ultimate questions. While attentive to empirical science, it builds its case not on authoritative pronouncements of experts that readers must take on faith, but instead on a nuanced understanding of universal principles implicit in everyone's experience.</p><p>Here is essential reading for all people who care about contemplating God, not exclusively as a best-explanation for the findings of science, but also as the surprising-yet-inevitable implication of our commonsense contact with reality. Augros harnesses such intellects as Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas, ushering into the light a wealth of powerful inferences that have hitherto received little or no public exposure. The result is an easygoing yet extraordinary journey, beginning from the world as we all encounter it and ending in the divine mind.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Augros</b> holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from Boston College and teaches at Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, California. He is the author of <i>Who Designed the Designer? A Rediscovered Path to God's Existence</i> and of numerous scholarly articles that have appeared in such journals as the <i>Thomist</i>, <i>Angelicum</i>, and the <i>National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly</i>.</p>This is, quite simply, the single best book I have ever read on what most of us would regard as the single most important question of philosophy: Does God exist? On all counts this book gets an A+. It is an amazing achievement. It will inevitably become a classic. --<strong>Peter Kreeft, Ph.D.</strong>, Professor of Philosophy, Boston College<p></p><br><br>Though many sound books have been written about the &#x2018;first cause/mover&#x2019; proof of Aristotle and St. Thomas, this is the most accessible and illustrative rendition I have encountered.&nbsp; His explanations make a heavy subject engaging and easy to read. It has outstanding pedagogical value. --<strong>Robert Spitzer, S.J., Ph.D.</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Author,&nbsp;<em>New Proofs for the Existence of God</em><br><br>Michael Augros is one of the smartest people I've met.

G. Jung, whose influence on contemporary religion and the humanities is beginning to become clear. Cheetham's books have helped spark a renewed interest in the work of this important, creative religious thinker.<br><br>Henry Corbin (1903-1978) was professor of Islamic religion at the Sorbonne in Paris and director of the department of Iranic studies at the Institut Franco-Iranien in Teheran. His wide-ranging work includes the first translations of Heidegger into French, studies in Swedenborg and Boehme, writings on the Grail and angelology, and definitive translations of Persian Islamic and Sufi texts. He introduced such seminal terms as "the imaginal realm" and "theophany" into Western thought, and his use of the Shi'ite idea of<i> ta'wil</i> or "spiritual interpretation" influenced psychologist James Hillman and the literary critic Harold Bloom. His books were read by a broad range of poets including Charles Olson and Robert Duncan, and his impact on American poetry, says Cheetham, has yet to be fully appreciated. His published titles in English include<i> Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn Arabi, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital</i>, and <i>The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism.</i><br><br>As the religions of the Book place the divine Word at the center of creation, the importance of hermaneutics, the theory and practice of interpretation, cannot be overstated. In the theology and spirituality of Henry Corbin, the mystical heart of this tradition is to be found in the creative, active imagination; the alchemy of spiritual development is best understood as a story of the soul's search for the Lost Speech. Cheetham eloquently demonstrates Corbin's view that the living interpretation of texts, whether divine or human&#x2014;or, indeed, of the world itself seen as the Text of Creation&#x2014;is the primary task of spiritual life.<br><br>In his first three books on Corbin, Cheetham explores different aspects of Corbin's work, but has saved for this book his final analysis of what Corbin meant by the Arabic term <i>ta'wil</i>&#x2014;perhaps the most important concept in his entire <i>oeuvre</i>. "Any consideration of how Corbin's ideas were adapted by others has to begin with a clear idea of what Corbin himself intended," writes Cheetham; "his own intellectual and spiritual cosmos is already highly complex and eclectic and a knowledge of his particular philosophical project is crucial for understanding the range and implications of his work." Cheetham lays out the implications of <i>ta'wil</i> as well as the use of language as integral part of any artistic or spiritual practice, with the view that the creative imagination is a fundamentally linguistic phenomenon for the Abrahamic religions, and, as Corbin tells us, prayer is the supreme form of creative imagination.</p><p>Tom Cheetham, PhD, is the author of four books on the implications of Henry Corbin&#39;s work for the contemporary world. With a background in philosophy and environmental studies, he turned his attention to the work of James Hillman and Henry Corbin in the mid-nineties, and has been writing and lecturing on Corbin since then. He is a Fellow of the Temenos Academy in London (Temenosacademy.org) and an adjunct professor at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine."For anyone attracted to the elusive realm of creative imagination, this book draws out and makes explicit what lives so strongly as a lure within the heart, the desire to find again our first home, the imaginal worlds and their inhabitants, the angels of creativity. As acknowledged master interpreter of the great work of Henry Corbin, Tom Cheetham follows Corbin&#x2019;s path of seeing all the world as living symbol of the divine worlds. More, he shows how to go through the portal of the world as symbol to enter the imaginal realms in their intimate autonomy, and develop impeccable trust in their spontaneous appearance as personal images. Here, in this writing, we can learn interior listening, discovering the inherent poeticizing action of the word.

With the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the age to come (i e , kingdom of God) broke into this present age but didn&#x2019;t end it. Where other important doctrines such as justification by faith, reconciliation, and the cross of Christ were key players in Paul&#x2019;s theology, Marvin Pate compellingly demonstrates that the overarching theme driving the Pauline corpus was indeed Paul&#x2019;s inaugurated eschatology. In fact, Paul&#x2019;s apocalyptic framework was only one of a number of other rival eschatologically focused religious perspectives of the day, such as the Imperial Cult, Hellenistic/syncretistic religion, and the <em>merkabah</em> Judaizers. Paul&#x2019;s vigorous debates with the churches he served centered on the exclusivity of the gospel of Christ that he preached: the nonnegotiable apocalypse of Jesus the Messiah. <em>Apostle of the Last Days</em> will be welcomed in the classroom as a one-volume treatment of Paul&#x2019;s life and letters as well as his theology.</p></p><p><p>C. Marvin Pate (PhD, Marquette University) is professor of biblical studies at Ouachita Baptist University.

This well-organized, clearly written volume will prove valuable to students and scholars alike.

Grounded in an admirable familiarity with both the ancient world of the New Testament and contemporary Pauline scholarship, Pate offers a wonderful introduction to the life, letters, and theology of the apostle Paul.&#x201d; (Paul Rhodes Eddy <i>Bethel University</i> 2013-11-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Paul&#x2019;s inaugurated eschatology was the determining factor in how the apostle understood the gospel, why he evangelized the world, and how he instructed his converts to live &#x2018;in between the times.&#x2019; In clear and concise terms, Pate takes us through the thicket of first-century ideas about the end of the world&#x2015;Jewish and Greco-Roman&#x2015;and explains why reading Paul apocalyptically not only helps us understand his letters, but also reveals why Paul&#x2019;s opponents attacked him. Pate masterfully reveals why we shouldn&#x2019;t make the same mistake as Paul&#x2019;s opponents, thereby missing the heart of the gospel according to Paul.&#x201d; (Rodney Reeves <i>Southwest Baptist University</i> 2013-11-01)</p><h2>Alice in Wonderland (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>This is a classic childhood story that has been abridged for younger readers.

As in Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem, Simon Singh brings life to an anstonishing story of puzzles, codes, languages and riddles that reveals man&#39;s continual pursuit to disguise and uncover, and to work out the secret languages of others. Codes have influenced events throughout history, both in the stories of those who make them and those who break them. The betrayal of Mary Queen of Scots and the cracking of the enigma code that helped the Allies in World War II are major episodes in a continuing history of cryptography. In addition to stories of intrigue and warfare, Simon Singh also investigates other codes, the unravelling of genes and the rediscovery of ancient languages and most tantalisingly, the Beale ciphers, an unbroken code that could hold the key to a $20 million treasure.</p><p>People love secrets, and ever since the first word was written, humans have written coded messages to each other. In <i>The Code Book</i>, Simon Singh, author of the bestselling <i>Fermat's Enigma</i>, offers a peek into the world of cryptography and codes, from ancient texts through computer encryption. Singh's compelling history is woven through with stories of how codes and ciphers have played a vital role in warfare, politics, and royal intrigue. The major theme of <i>The Code Book</i> is what Singh calls "the ongoing evolutionary battle between codemakers and codebreakers," never more clear than in the chapters devoted to World War II. Cryptography came of age during that conflict, as secret communications became critical to either side's success. <p> </p> <blockquote> Confronted with the prospect of defeat, the Allied cryptanalysts had worked night and day to penetrate German ciphers. It would appear that fear was the main driving force, and that adversity is one of the foundations of successful codebreaking. </blockquote> <p> In the information age, the fear that drives cryptographic improvements is both capitalistic and libertarian--corporations need encryption to ensure that their secrets don't fall into the hands of competitors and regulators, and ordinary people need encryption to keep their everyday communications private in a free society. Similarly, the battles for greater <i>decryption</i> power come from said competitors and governments wary of insurrection. <i>The Code Book</i> is an excellent primer for those wishing to understand how the human need for privacy has manifested itself through cryptography. Singh's accessible style and clear explanations of complex algorithms cut through the arcane mathematical details without oversimplifying. Can't get enough crypto? Try solving the Cipher Challenge in the back of the book--$15,000 goes to the first person to crack the code! <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Codes have decided the fates of empires, countries, and monarchies throughout recorded history. Mary, Queen of Scots was put to death by her cousin, Queen Elizabeth, for the high crime of treason after spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham cracked the secret code she used to communicate with her conspirators. And thus the course of British history was altered by a few sheets of cryptic prose. This is just one link in humankind's evolutionary chain of secret communication, and just one of the fascinating incidents recounted in <b>The Code Book</b>, written by bestselling author Simon Singh. <br> <br>Combining a superb storyteller's sense of drama and a scientist's appreciation for technical perfection, Singh traces the evolution of secret writing from ancient Greek military espionage to the frontiers of computer science. The result is an epic tale of human ingenuity, with examples that range from the poignant to the peculiar to the world-historical. <br> <br>There is the case of the Beale ciphers, which involves Wild West escapades, a cowboy who amassed a vast fortune, a buried treasure worth $20 million, and a mysterious set of encrypted papers describing its whereabouts--papers that have baffled generations of cryptanalysts and captivated hundreds of treasure hunters. <br> <br>A speedier end to a bloody war was the only reward that could be promised to the Allied code breakers of World Wars I and II, whose selfless contributions altered the course of history; but few of them lived to receive any credit for their top-secret accomplishments. Among the most moving of these stories is that of the World War II British code breaker Alan Turing, who gave up a brilliant career in mathematics to devote himself to the Allied cause, only to end his years punished by the state for his homosexuality, while his heroism was ignored. No less heroic were the Navajo code talkers, who volunteered without hesitation to risk their lives for the Allied forces in the Japanese theater, where they were routinely mistaken for the enemy. <br> <br>Interspersed with these gripping stories are clear mathematical, linguistic, and technological demonstrations of codes, as well as illustrations of the remarkable personalities--many courageous, some villainous, and all obsessive--who wrote and broke them. <br> <br>All roads lead to the present day, in which the possibility of a truly unbreakable code looms large. Singh explores this possibility, and the ramifications of our increasing need for privacy, even as it begins to chafe against the stated mission of the powerful and deeply secretive National Security Agency. Entertaining, compelling, and remarkably far-reaching, this is a book that will forever alter your view of history, what drives it, and how private that e-mail you just sent really is. <br> <br>Included in the book is a worldwide Cipher Challenge--a $15,000 award will be given by the author to the first reader who cracks the code successfully. Progress toward the solution will be tracked on The Code Book website.</p><h2>No Way</h2><p><b>In the sequel to the terrifying science fiction thriller, <i>One Way</i>, returning home from Mars may mean striking a deal with the very people who abandoned him.</b><b><br></b>They were sent to build a utopia, but all they found on Mars was death.<br><br>Frank Kitteridge has been abandoned.

Based in part on the author&#x2019;s own experiences, it provides a stirring narrative of what the war was actually like, from the point of view of the children&#x2014;for children they were&#x2014;who fought it. While dealing definitively with issues of strategy, leadership, context, and tactics, Fussell has an additional purpose: to tear away the veil of feel-good mythology that so often obscures and sanitizes war&#x2019;s brutal essence. <br><br>&#x201c;A chronicle should deal with nothing but the truth,&#x201d; Fussell writes in his Preface. Accord-ingly, he eschews every kind of sentimentalism, focusing instead on the raw action and human emotion triggered by the intimacy, horror, and intense sorrows of war, and honestly addressing the errors, waste, fear, misery, and resentments that plagued both sides. In the vast literature on World War II, <i>The Boys&#x2019; Crusade</i> stands wholly apart. Fussell&#x2019;s profoundly honest portrayal of these boy soldiers underscores their bravery even as it deepens our awareness of their experiences. This book is both a tribute to their noble service and a valuable lesson for future generations.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a former warrior&#x2019;s haunting meditation on the terrible, yet often necessary, destructiveness of total warfare.

Over eight days of bargaining, bombast, and intermittent bonhomie, while Soviet soldiers and NKVD men patrolled the grounds of the three palaces occupied by their delegations, they decided, among other things, on the endgame of the war against Nazi Germany and how a defeated and occupied Germany should be governed, on the constitution of the nascent United Nations, on the price of Soviet entry into the war against Japan, on the new borders of Poland, and on spheres of influence elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and Greece.<br><p><br>With the deep insight of a skilled historian, drawing on the memorable accounts of those who were there&#x2015;from the leaders and high level advisors such as Averell Harriman, Anthony Eden, and Andrei Gromyko, to Churchill&#x2019;s clear-eyed secretary Marian Holmes and FDR&#x2019;s insightful daughter Anna Boettiger&#x2015;Diana Preston has, on the 75th anniversary of this historic event, crafted a masterful and vivid chronicle of the conference that created the post-war world, out of which came decisions that still resonate loudly today.<br></p><p> <br>Ever since, who &#x201c;won&#x201d; Yalta has been debated.

"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire" deals with the underlying structure of occult teaching for the present era, with vast cosmic processes reproduced through all areas of life from universe to atom. It is, therefore, no book for the proof-demanding concrete mind, or for those who dabble in the spectacular and the phenomenal. The true student, however, the seriously applied aspirant, will find his mind stimulated and his consciousness expanded. </p><p> The book is dedicated to Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and is said to be "the psychological key to the Cosmic Creation". Certainly in its revelation of relationship and correspondences throughout the Cosmos, all aspects of life unfolding through consciousness are included, based on the aphorism--"Having pervaded the entire universe with one fragment of Myself, I remain." </p><p> <br>The One Life manifests through all form within the universe as fiery energy; and the three main streams of cosmic energy, differentiated into seven systemic rays, are shown in relation to the three aspects of fire controlling all manifested life: Electric Fire, the Fire of Spirit; Solar Fire, the Fire of Mind; Fire by Friction, the Internal Fires. </p><p> <br>A large section of the book is directed to a detailed exposition of Solar Fire, the Fire of Mind, since this is the dominant energy to be understood and controlled during this second solar system. The cosmic Laws operating through the system are shown in relation to the lesser laws of planetary origin and the laws of nature, operating through substance, as distinct from the life and the consciousness of the planet. </p><p> <br>In her foreword to the book, the author mentions a five-fold purpose within its teaching; briefly: (a) To provide a compact and skeleton outline of a scheme of cosmology, philosophy and psychology which may serve as a reference and textbook; (b) As an elucidation of the relation between Spirit and Matter, demonstrating as consciousness; (c) To show the coherent development of all that is found within a solar system and to demonstrate that everything evolves; (d) To give practical information about focal points of energy found in the etheric bodies of the Solar Logos, the macrocosm, and of man, the microcosm; (e) To give some information of the place and work of those sentient lives who form the essence of objectivity, and to indicate the nature of the Hierarchies of Existences who form out of their own substance all that is seen and known. </p><p> <br>These five objectives, and more, the book encompasses; for the effect in the individual consciousness is such that theories become transcended and the mind begins to experience through contemplative thought what the words on paper reveal to the intelligence. The finite human mind can touch its cosmic origins and its fiery essence when it opens to the three cosmic Laws of Synthesis, of Attraction and of Economy. </p><p> <br>The fire of love, the flame of life within the heart, is the touchstone for all intuitive thought, and the alchemist to the dense materiality of gross substance. </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching.</p><h2>Oh, Fudge!

Wang as well as by the author himself. Payaguaje shares his sincere imaginal view into the spiritual life of the Secoya; plates of petroglyphs from the sacred valley of Cotundo relate to an ancient language, and other illustrations show traditional Secoya ayahuasca symbols and indigenous origin myths. Two color sections showcase photos of the plants and people of the region, and include plates of previously unpublished full-color paintings by Pablo Cesar Amaringo (1938-2009), an acclaimed Peruvian artist renowned for his intricate, colorful depictions of his visions from drinking the entheogenic plant brew, <i>ayahuasca</i> ("vine of the soul" in Quechua languages). <br><br>Today the once-dense mysterious rainforest realms are under assault as the indiscriminate colonial frontier of resource extraction moves across the region; as the forest disappears, the traditional human legacy of sustainable utilization of this rich ecosystem is also being buried under modern realities. With over 20 years experience of ground-level environmental and cultural conservation, author Jonathon Miller Weisberger's commitment to preserving the fascinating, unfathomably precious relics of the indigenous legacy shines through. Chief among these treasures is the "shimmering" "golden" plant-medicine science of <i>ayahuasca</i> or <i>yaj�,</i> a rainforest vine that was popularized in the 1950s by Western travelers such as William Burroughs and Alan Ginsberg. It has been sampled, reviled, and celebrated by outsiders ever since.<br><br>Currently sought after by many in the industrialized West for its powerful psychotropic and life-transforming effects, this sacred brew is often imbibed by visitors to the upper Amazon and curious seekers in faraway venues, sometimes with little to no working knowledge of its principles and precepts. Perceiving that there is an evident need for in-depth information on ayahuasca if it is to be used beyond its traditional context for healing and spiritual illumination in the future, Miller Weisberger focuses on the fundamental knowledge and practices that guide the use of ayahuasca in indigenous cultures. Weaving first-person narrative with anthropological and ethnobotanical information, <i>Rainforest Medicine</i> aims to preserve both the record and ongoing reality of ayahuasca's unique tradition and, of course, the priceless forest that gave birth to these sacred vines. Featuring words from Amazonian shamans--the living torchbearers of these sophisticated spiritual practices--the book stands as testimony to this sacred plant medicine's power in shaping and healing individuals, communities, and nature alike.</p><p>Ethnobotanist JONATHON &#34;SPARROW&#34; MILLER WEISBERGER was raised in Ecuador and the U.S. He has collected over 2,000 herbarium specimens, including first-time collections of several new species. From 1990 to 2000, Jonathon lived in the Ecuadorian Amazon among five indigenous nationalities, and was influential in the creation of three reserves including the Napo-Galeras National Park. He participated in the demarcation of Waorani territory and in groundwork that helped the Secoya people retain a significant tract of their ancestral homelands. He is the executive director of the Council for Cultural and Biological Diversity (known in Latin America as Fundaci�n OSA), supporting rainforest conservation and cultural heritage projects in Ecuador and Costa Rica. He is the steward of Guaria de Osa Ecolodge (guariadeosa.com), a rainforest and ocean discovery and education center on the remote Osa peninsula, Costa Rica. The author lives in Guaria de Osa, Costa Rica."People interested in indigenous uses of ayahuasca will enjoy reading this book. Author JMW shares&nbsp;what he has seen, heard and experienced during long years spent with indigenous Amazonian people. He discusses the dangers of sorcery even for those who do not believe in it, as well as the importance of keeping quiet about one's visions. He also discusses a jaguar-centered world view, in which jaguar embodies energy, and energy makes up the universe. JMW &nbsp;shares nugget after nugget of Secoya wisdom about how to work with rainforest medicines. This book is personal rather than academic, and its approach is "kaleidoscopic", but it is packed with knowledge, experience and respect for indigenous cultures.

All of these titles were written before the turn of the 20th Century, but both contain eerie similarities with modern day political events. For the first time, all the works are presented in a single volume so readers can decipher for themselves whether Lockwood&#x2019;s words were a telling of things to come, or just a curious coincidence of American literature.</p><p>In the 1890s, Ingersoll Lockwood authored a series of children&#x2019;s books about the escapades of his character, the young Baron Trump: Travels and Adventures of Little Baron Trump and his Wonderful Dog Bulger, and Baron Trump&#x2019;s Marvellous Underground Journey. The series followed a literary trend of the time, which had child protagonists adventuring to enchanted lands and encountering fantastic beings. Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s Alice in Wonderland, and L. Frank Baum&#x2019;s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz are two famous examples of this genre.</p><p>Lockwood&#x2019;s Baron is an aristocratic youth bored with his life of luxury in Castle Trump. Searching for adventure, Baron travels to Russia to discover an underground world beneath his feet. He journeys downward and finds himself lost in peculiar settings surrounded by the strange inhabitants of this new world. The stories follow his adventures and eventual struggle to find his way back to the surface he left behind.</p><p>The Baron Trump novels were obscured by the more successful children&#x2019;s books of the time. Lockwood&#x2019;s tall tales seemed destined for the literary dust bin, but the election of Donald Trump in 2016 renewed interest in these works due to the President&#x2019;s youngest son&#x2019;s name: Barron Trump. Now, back in print, the Baron Trump series is enjoying considerable interest and success.</p><p>In 1900; Or, The Last President, Ingersoll Lockwood paints a&nbsp;picture of a politically charged New York City, where a political outsider has overcome stiff opposition to be elected President of the United States. Mob rule threatens, and marching protests rove up and down Fifth Avenue. The scene is an uncanny reflection of what happened as Donald Trump spent his days as President Elect holed up in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue as he awaited his inauguration.</p></p><p>Ingersoll Lockwood was born at Ossining, New York, in August 1841 to a well-known legal family. His father, Munson Lockwood, was a brigadier general in the New York State Militia, a lawyer, and also went on to hold the position of Warden at the famous Sing Sing prison. Both of Ingersoll�s uncles, Ralph and Albert Lockwood, were also attorneys. Ingersoll was trained in the law, but before establishing a practice, he was appointed Consul to the Kingdom of Hanover by the Lincoln Administration � becoming the youngest member of a U.S. delegation. After his federal service, Ingersoll came back to New York City where he established a successful firm with his brother Henry. In addition to his legal work, Ingersoll began a writing career, which included political essays, fiction and poetry. His most successful works were his children�s novels surrounding the character of Baron Trump. He retired to Saratoga Springs New York where he continued to write, publishing his last book of poetry five years before his death in 1918.</p><h2>Witches, Werewolves, and Fairies: Shapeshifters and Astral Doubles in the Middle Ages</h2><p>Reveals the true nature of medieval belief in the Double of the Soul <br><br>� Demonstrates the survival of a pagan belief that each individual owns three souls, including a double that can journey outside the physical body <br><br>� Explains the nature of death and the Other World hidden beneath the monsters and superstitions in stories from the Middle Ages <br><br>Monsters, werewolves, witches, and fairies remain a strong presence in our stories and dreams. But as Claude Lecouteux shows, their roots go far deeper than their appearance in medieval folklore; they are survivors of a much older belief system that predates Christianity and was widespread over Western Europe. Through his extensive analysis of Germano-Scandinavian legends, as well as those from other areas of Europe, Lecouteux has uncovered an almost forgotten religious concept: that every individual owns three souls and that one of these souls, the Double, can&#x2014;in animal or human form&#x2014;leave the physical body while in sleep or a trance, journey where it chooses, then reenter its physical body. While there were many who experienced this phenomenon involuntarily, there were others&#x2014;those who attracted the unwelcome persecution of the Church&#x2014;who were able to provoke it at will: witches. <br><br>In a thorough excavation of the medieval soul, Claude Lecouteux reveals the origin and significance of this belief in the Double, and follows its transforming features through the ages. He shows that far from being fantasy or vague superstition, fairies, witches, and werewolves all testify to a consistent ancient vision of our world and the world beyond.</p><p>Claude Lecouteux is a professor of medieval literature and civilization at the Sorbonne.

He lives in Paris.MYTHOLOGY <br> <br>Otherworldly beings--among them werewolves, witches, and fairies--have figured in our stories and dreams since the Middle Ages. But as Claude Lecouteux shows, their roots reach back to a much older Western European belief system that predates Christianity. Through his study of Germano-Scandinavian myths and legends, as well as those from other areas of Europe, he has uncovered the almost forgotten concept that every individual has three souls, and that one of these souls--the Double--can, in animal or human form, leave the physical body and journey where it chooses. While there were many people during the Middle Ages who experienced this phenomenon involuntarily, there were others--witches--who were able to provoke it at will, thus attracting the persecution of the Church. <br> <br>In a thorough study of the medieval soul, the author reveals eerie and surprising accounts of contact with the Double and otherworldly phenomena, such as second sight and psychic foreknowledge.

What can be done to decolonize mentalities, economic structures, and political institutions? In this book, which includes the first translation of the text 'Analysis of a Few Types of Resistance' as well as 'The Role of Culture in the Struggle for Independence,' the African revolutionary Am�lcar Cabral explores these and other questions. These texts demonstrate his frank and insightful directives to his comrades in Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde's party for independence, as well as reflections on culture and combat written the year prior to his assassination by the Portuguese secret police. <br>As one of the most important and profound African revolutionary leaders in the 20th century, and justly compared in importance to Frantz Fanon, Cabral's thoughts and instructions as articulated here help us to rethink important issues concerning nationalism, culture, vanguardism, revolution, liberation, colonialism, race, and history. The volume also includes two introductory essays: the first introduces Cabral's work within the context of Africana critical theory, and the second situates these texts in their historical-political context and analyzes their relevance for contemporary anti-imperialism.</p><p><b>Am�lcar Cabral</b> (1924-1973) was a writer, intellectual and one of Africa's foremost anticolonial leaders. He led the nationalist movement for Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde Islands and the ensuing revolution for independence in Guinea Bissau. He was assassinated by the Portuguese secret police in January 1973.<b>Dan Wood</b>, the editor and translator, is a PhD candidate in Philosophy at Villanova University.<b>Reiland Rabaka</b> is Professor of African, African American and Caribbean Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder."Amilcar Cabral defines African critical theory as well as radical African politics. This book shows the unfailing engagement and the rigourous thinking a concrete philosopher needs in order to decolonize a society. That's true even in contemporary struggles. This book belongs to the "postcolonial library."&nbsp;-Seloua Luste Boulbina, Research Associate in Philosophy, University of Paris VII"Wood's essay, "Imbrications of Coloniality: An Introduction to Cabralist Critical Theory in Relation to Contemporary Struggles," contributes an elegant and eloquent contextualization of Cabral's thought. Students of Cabral who have an appreciation for those works that examine Cabral as more than a philosopher or theorist will appreciate Wood's attention to the context of these lectures to the PAIGC. Wood's attention to Cabral's analysis of religion in the context of the "coloniality of religious power" (61) is, as Woods states, quite timely."&nbsp;-Charles Peterson, Journal of Lusophone Studies"Resistance and Decolonization is a tour-de-force in the bourgeoning field of Cabral studies and/or the epistemology that can be called Cabralism from the decolonial epistemic perspective. The spectre of Cabral haunts us and the fundamental questions which he raises from the positionality of being dehumanized bring about the unmasking of coloniality in the modern colonial world. Dan Wood's translation, as a decolonial testament, instils that Cabral still lives and another world is possible."-Tendayi Sithole, Associate Professor of African Politics, University of South Africa.&nbsp;"Wood has [...] performed a great service with this translation, not just to those who maintain an interest in African philosophy or Global Theory, but to philosophers, cultural critics, political scientists, and political theorists more generally."-Review 31&nbsp;"Cabral offers rich insight into the role and importance of culture in expanding Marxism to address modern national liberation and identity movements. Cabral is then useful to a broad range of philosophers and activists in critical race theory, politics of identity, transitional justice, and decolonialism. More generally, Resistance and Decolonialization is essential and successful in rendering African critical theory and its rich insights more visible. Marx &amp; Philosophy Review of Books This is a very important and timely publication that adds to existing collections of Am�lcar Cabral's revolutionary writings and is therefore a welcome addition to the works of one of the most original African thinkers of national emancipation during the 20th century."&nbsp;-Theory &amp; Event"These essays introduce us to Cabral the trans-disciplinary Africana critical social theorist, who picks up the weapon of theory not only in liberation of the wretched of the earth, but also to eradicate 'the condition of wretchedness' and 'realise anticolonial revolution, trans-ethnic working-class struggle and revolutionary humanism.'"&nbsp;-Leiden Journal of International Law</p><h2>Days of Hunger, Days of Chaos</h2><p>"Nothing to Eat," screams the newspaper headlines.

Is/are it/they god/gods from outer space, or somewhere closer to home? Rudi faces more mundane problems, too, such as whether he is in the process of becoming a father. The pacing of the opening is breakneck, and no concessions whatsoever are made to readers unfamiliar with the series&#x2019; backstory and characters (so perhaps this isn&#x2019;t the book to start reading the saga with; then, again . . .). After awhile, things slow down somewhat, but never too much. Stirling is a perfect master of keep-them-up-all-night pacing, possibly the best in American sf, quite capable of sweeping readers all the way to the end, with a galley going under a bridge in Dubuque in the Provisional Republic of Iowa, and leaving them crying for more.

The new dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, instituted a reign of terror and turned Chile into a laboratory to test the poisonous prescriptions of the American economist Milton Friedman. In 1985, Litt�n returned to Chile disguised as a Uruguayan businessman. He was desperate to see the homeland he&#x2019;d been exiled from for so many years; he also meant to pull off a very tricky stunt: with the help of three film crews from three different countries, each supposedly busy making a movie to promote tourism, he would secretly put together a film that would tell the truth about Pinochet&#x2019;s benighted Chile&#x2014;a film that would capture the world&#x2019;s attention while landing the general and his secret police with a very visible black eye. <br><br>Afterwards, the great novelist Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez sat down with Litt�n to hear the story of his escapade, with all its scary, comic, and not-a-little surreal ups and downs. Then, applying the same unequaled gifts that had already gained him a Nobel Prize, Garc�a M�rquez wrote it down.<i> Clandestine in Chile</i> is a true-life adventure story and a classic of modern reportage.</p><p>Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez (b. 1928) was born in Aracataca, Colombia. He began working as a reporter while studying law at the University of Cartagena and published his first book, the novella<i> The Leaf Storm,</i> in Bogota in 1955. Among his best-known subsequent works are the novels<i> One Hundred Years of Solitude, Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Love in the Time of Cholera,</i> and <i>The General in His Labyrinth</i>. In 1986 he wrote <i>Clandestine in Chile: The Adventures of Miguel Litt�n,</i> about an exile&#x2019;s return to the repressive Chile of General Augusto Pinochet. The political revelations of the book led to the burning of almost 15,000 copies by the Chilean government. Garc�a M�rquez has lived primarily in Mexico since the 1960s, and in 1982 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.<br><br>Asa Zatz was born in Mexico and has translated nearly one hundred books.

To pass the time on the long drive, she got hooked on audiobooks-especially books with love stories. Within a couple of years, she was writing stories of her own.

Unable to return home, alone, and on the brink of destitution, she finds herself seduced by the tango, the dance that underscores every aspect of life in her new city. Knowing that she can never play in public as a woman, Leda disguises herself as a young man to join a troupe of musicians. In the illicit, scandalous world of brothels and cabarets, the line between Leda and her disguise begins to blur, and forbidden longings that she has long kept suppressed are realized for the first time. Powerfully sensual, <i>The Gods of Tango</i> is an erotically charged story of music, passion, and the quest for an authentic life against the odds.</p><p>Carolina De Robertis, a writer of Uruguayan origins, is the author of two previous novels, <i>Perla</i> and <i>The Invisible Mountain</i> (a Best Book of 2009 according to the <i>San Francisco Chronicle; O, The Oprah Magazine;</i> and <i>Booklist</i>), and the recipient of Italy&#x2019;s Rhegium Julii Prize and a 2012 fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Her writings and literary translations have appeared in <i>Zoetrope: All-Story, Granta, The Virginia Quarterly Review,</i> the anthology <i>Immigrant Voices,</i> and elsewhere. Her novels have been translated into seventeen languages. She lives in Oakland, California.That afternoon, Leda went out to the market, her small chance of escaping the conventillo<i> </i>by herself. Francesca had warned her very clearly to head right down the block to the stores and vendors, then return quickly home. But she was starved to see more of the city. The conventillo caged her in. She hadn&#x2019;t planned to break the rules and stray, but, after filling her basket with loaves from Alfonso Di Bacco, who extolled her beauty and dispensed paternal advice as he had come to do each day&#x2014;<i>where there&#x2019;s life, there&#x2019;s hope&#x2014;choose neither linen nor a man by candlelight&#x2014;the best word is the one that goes unspoken</i>&#x2014;she stood at the corner and stared down the block at unknown buildings, unseen doors and rooms and lives, carriages pulled by horses clopclopping their way to places they knew and she did not, their manes gleaming in the late sun before they dove into shadows, and she thought, what harm can it do to walk a little in the light of day? Can it really be so dangerous? She set out down the block, crossed the street and kept walking. People, streaming everywhere, women in doorways, old men in caf�s or pushing ramshackle handcarts, calling out not in Italian, but in Spanish, that strange language that sounded like the Italian of an alternate planet. A planet of drunkards, perhaps. Already she understood more glimmers of it, which meant she was either learning Spanish or getting drunk on this place, or both. The streets were crowded with people, innumerable people who&#x2019;d arrived before her to the land of promise and already staked their space. Land of promise you have promised too much already to the thousands. She walked on. Her ear caught shreds of other languages. She heard a woman in a doorway speaking sounds unlike anything she&#x2019;d heard before, at once angular and melodic. For all she knew it could be the tongue of demons or the gods. Further on, children called to their mothers from inside the house, in Spanish, Italian, another unknown tongue. Two girls with baskets walked purposefully past her, gossiping in French. At a caf�, an old man told a joke in the Neapolitan dialect to a group of men who laughed appreciatively. More Napoletanos. She had imagined, in her brief visit to Naples, that that would be all she&#x2019;d see of the city, but Naples had followed her across the ocean. It surrounded her. It had invaded Buenos Aires. And isn&#x2019;t that strange, she thought, the way one city can swirl inside another; the way you can be in one country yet carry another country in your skin; the way a place is changed by whoever comes to it, the way silt invades the body of a river. She was that, a speck of silt. The thought thrilled her but it also made her want to weep without reason, or for reasons utterly unknown to her. With every immigrant she passed she longed to stop and stare into his or her face and ask with nothing but her gaze <i>And you? What are you here for? Why did you come?</i>, as though just looking at them might unlatch the trapdoor to their hidden stories. And the stories would be infinite, no two alike, burning with hope and loss and vigorous despair, told in more dialects than even God could possibly speak, and yet, she suddenly saw, it was possible that somewhere beneath the surface all their hidden stories held the same thread, a single hum of longing, <i>I came to live. </i>Surely this was true for all of them, including her. And Buenos Aires, tell me, is there any chance that I can forge a space for myself somewhere in the folds of you? (She turned a corner and kept walking.) Will I ever rove these raucous streets with familiarity and with no fear? She walked and walked. The thrum of her feet, the thrum of the city. She felt hypnotized, expanded, and all the things around her&#x2014;doors, people, brightly painted walls&#x2014;threatened to tear her open with their sheer existence. She had never felt more awake in her life. The voices of the city blended and poured into her, filling her up, radiant, sweetly fatal, and that was when she understood that whatever this city was, whatever it held, she wanted it. All of it. She wanted Buenos Aires inside her, around her, covering her skin like a film of sweat. She wanted the breath of this city in her lungs no matter the danger, no matter the other story about the good girl who stays locked inside with needle and thread until she can get back to her home village, to hell with that story, she wanted freedom, wanted to taste this place even if it killed her. She felt exhilarated and afraid of her own exhilaration. Was she going mad? Cora, is this how it was for you? She stopped, leaned against a wall, and closed her eyes. Her mind warred between collecting itself and falling even deeper into thrall.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Se�orita?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She opened her eyes. A man stood before her, hat in hand. He had a kind enough face but his gaze was too raw. He said something in Spanish that she did not understand. Then he smiled and placed his hand on her arm. Her skin prickled. She tried to pull away, but his hand followed and gripped her tightly.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leda tore away from him and ran. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was lost. One turn, two, and she was on a block she&#x2019;d never seen before. Old men played dice on the sidewalk, bickering in a strident Italian. They spoke her language but now she was afraid to ask for help, and the thought pushed in before she could stop it, <i>I want my Mamma, Mamma where are you? </i>But Mamma was not here, she was unreachable, twenty steamship days away across a great blue ocean of impossible. She tried going the other way. Her arm ached from the basket&#x2019;s weight, she shifted it to the other side and kept walking and walking until she reached the end of a street that let out to the port, and there she saw the ships and cargo, men working high up on ladders, hauling crates, sweat beading on their faces, and one of them&#x2014;Dante! Her cousin, her husband!&#x2014;turned as if to call to her, but no, he was not Dante, his gaze moved blankly on and he wiped his face and resumed his burden. Dante was dead and did not work here anymore. You are alone, Leda. Alone. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took her another hour to find her way home. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where were you?&#x201d; Francesca scolded as soon as she arrived. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just wander around this city. You don&#x2019;t know what happens to women out there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Leda couldn&#x2019;t sleep. She tossed and turned, feverish with thoughts. She thought of the city, pulsing beyond the walls of her conventillo, bursting with life and noise and peril. The thought of Dante and the moment at the port: it was him, it was not him, he would never be at the port again. His absence stabbed her. She wondered what he&#x2019;d felt when he&#x2019;d walked the streets she walked today. Whether they&#x2019;d amazed him as they had her. She longed to ask him. Longed to close the gap between his life and hers.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She went to the armoire and opened its doors for the first time. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His clothes were all there, as promised. Musty air welled toward her, tinged with the scent of mothballs, dry sweat, and decay. At first, she touched the clothing with trepidation, not wanting to disturb its sleep; but then she found herself taking out a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest, a jacket. She laid them on the bed in the shape of a man. They were empty clothes, nothing more. She touched them again. How had they felt against his skin? And then, before her mind could ask her body what it was doing, she was taking off her nightgown and putting on the shirt, trousers, vest, in an act that would surely scandalize the living if not the dead. Her hips slipped smoothly into the trousers. Her body flushed with hot alarm. What if someone walked into her room now? No, that would not happen. No one ever walked into her room after she retired for the night. Still she could not shake the sense of an unutterable danger. Dante, can you forgive me? Am I violating your memory, or paying it tribute? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was shocking, how comfortably his clothes fit. The shirt swelled a little over her breasts. It felt strange to have two layers of fabric between her thighs. How different it must be to walk with the sheath of trousers between your legs rather than a crowd of petticoats rustling around them. She tried it, stalking the room, hesitantly at first, then more boldly, imagining how Dante might have strode on his way to work in the mornings, full of muscle and determination, full of hope. And if he passed another man he would not modestly bow his head and avert his eyes, but rather nod to him, chin high, shoulders squared against the world. Wasn&#x2019;t that how men did it? She wasn&#x2019;t sure. She knew how it looked from the outside, this walk of men, but not how it felt from within. She tried it, walked an imaginary street, passed an imaginary man, nodded, not slow-forehead-down, as women do, but quick-chin-up. She felt preposterous, but she also felt something else: a delectable rush. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took the clothes off, quickly, then stared at them, bunched on the floor. What had she done? She would never do that again. In that instant, with all her soul, she swore that she never would.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She broke the vow the following night. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, she put the clothes on slowly, buttoning with fingers still sore from a day&#x2019;s sewing. Then she looked at herself in a hand-mirror, tilting it up and down her body in the lamplight. She looked like a man. She felt like a man&#x2014;or, at least, she felt the way she imagined a man might feel: emboldened, like she could walk all the way to the end of her neighborhood and people would leave her alone. Like she could walk into a caf� in the middle of the night and the barman would serve her, casually, like she was just a normal customer, like all she was asking for was a damn drink. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was not a man. She was a woman. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wasn&#x2019;t she?<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of woman does this thing you&#x2019;re doing right now?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question rose out of the air and coiled around her. She didn&#x2019;t want to think about the answer but she also didn&#x2019;t want to take off Dante&#x2019;s clothes. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You should take them off. You disgusting girl. Take them off. </i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>She stood still for a long time. Something broke apart inside her. She sensed that the longer the clothes stayed on her body, the more irreparable the change would become. And yet she made no move to take the clothes off. Instead her hands reached for the instrument case and took out the violin. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She played.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moves were becoming more familiar to her hands. With men&#x2019;s clothes on, her hands moved more smoothly, with more strength and confidence, and this surprised her. It was difficult to keep silent&#x2014;she longed to hear the motion of her fingers, to test the quality of her sound. But she did not break the silence; the silence was her shield, her refuge. And soon her fingers&#x2019; music filled her mind and drowned out the hostile voice that had demanded she take the clothes off. The voice slunk into the corners of the room, where it crouched, shrunken in momentary defeat, helpless in the face of silent music.</p><h2>Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits (Paul Simon/Simon &amp; Garfunkel)</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Simondon&#x2019;s prolific intellectual curiosity led his philosophical and scientific reflections to traverse a variety of areas of research, including philosophy, psychology, the beginnings of cybernetics, and the foundations of religion. For Simondon, the human/machine distinction is perhaps not a simple dichotomy. There is much we can learn from our technical objects, and while it has been said that humans have an alienating rapport with technical objects, Simondon takes up the task of a true thinker who sees the potential for humanity to uncover life-affirming modes of technical objects whereby we can discover potentiality for novel, healthful, and dis-alienating rapports with them. For Simondon, by way of studying its genesis, one must grant to the technical object the same ontological status as that of the aesthetic object or even a living being. His work thus opens up exciting new entry points into studying the human&#x2019;s rapport with its continually changing technical reality. This first complete English-language translation of Gilbert Simondon&#x2019;s groundbreaking and influential work finally presents to Anglophone readers one of the pinnacle works of France&#x2019;s most unique thinkers of technics.</p><br></p><p><p>Gilbert Simondon (1924&#x2013;1989)&nbsp;was a French philosopher of technology whose work continues to attract new interest within a variety of academic fields.</p><br></p><h2>The Enduring Shore: A History of Cape Cod, Martha&#39;s Vineyard, and Nantucket</h2><p><p>Even before the Pilgrims landed in 1620, Cape Cod and its islands promised paradise to visitors, both native and European. In Paul Schneider's sure hands, the story of this waterland created by glaciers and refined by storms and tides -- and of its varied inhabitants -- becomes an irresistible biography of a place.</p><p>Cape Cod's Great Beach, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket are romantic stops on Schneider's roughly chronological human and natural history. His book is a lucid and compelling collage of seaside ecology, Indians and colonists, religion and revolution, shipwrecks and hurricanes, whalers and vengeful sperm whales, glorious clipper ships and today's beautiful but threatened beaches. Schneider's superb eye for story and detail illuminates both history and landscape. A wonderful introduction, it will also appeal to the millions of people who already have warm associations with these magical places.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Schneider</b>, author of the highly praised and successful <b>The Adirondacks</b>, a 1997 <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book, lives with his wife and child in Martha's Vineyard.</p>Billed as the first history of Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and Elizabeth Islands in 50 years, this animated if loosely organized book blends stories of the region's rich heritage with tales of the author's adventures kayaking the local current-riven waters. A Vineyard resident himself, Schneider begins by describing the culture of the area's Nauset and Wampanoag Indians, noting that they had 125 years of contact with adventurous Europeans before the Mayflower's Pilgrims clambered ashore in Provincetown Harbor in 1620. Schneider identifies the geological machinations of the last ice age, which engulfed the northern half of the continent and sculpted the cape, islands and shoals he clearly loves. He retells the tragedy of the whaleship Essex as he juggles his way through New England's whaling heyday. More contemporary topics--such as the current milieus of the various communities and the ecological ravages of DDT in the 1960s--also emerge and recede in an energetic whirl of information. But Schneider's method is more enthusiastic than rigorous, often clouding the chronology of events. Though his literary prose can be engaging, some readers may tire of his rambling. A history of place is especially prone to fragmentation, and this talented writer has allowed his book to succumb to that weakness.

Sunday, Christmas Eve, 1944.<p></p> <br>Three months before they dropped into Germany, the troopers of the 17th Airborne entered combat for the first time in a manner entirely different from how they&#x2019;d been trained. Without much warning, they&#x2019;d been rushed to the front to set up blocking positions along the Meuse River on Christmas Eve 1944. Platoons of paratroopers, not fully aware of what was going on, found themselves digging foxholes in the Meuse-Argonne Cemetery, the final resting place for thousands of Americans killed in the previous world war. The men dug in and waited for orders, each contemplating the odds of becoming a permanent European resident himself. They were as ready as they could be, but like all unseasoned troops, most had no idea what they were about to endure.<br> <br>Lynn Aas&#x2019; platoon stopped to dig their defensive positions in a field littered with frozen American and German corpses. The cold, dead faces of the enemy reminded the twenty-three-year-old rifleman of his German and Ukrainian neighbors back in North Dakota. As he stood there in the snow, a nagging unease took hold of him . . . he had no desire to kill these people.<br> <br>But knowing the task ahead required resolve, he walked over to one of the bodies and forced himself to stare. In life, the young German had been tall and handsome. Feeling the need to build up his hate, Aas kicked the corpse. This is war, he thought. He is my enemy; I need to prove to myself that I can destroy him. In the coming days almost all of his fellow troopers would get an opportunity to ignite their hate too.<br> <br>On December 16, Hitler had launched a massive surprise assault to recapture Antwerp, Belgium, and divide British and American forces. The desperate gamble, what would later be referred to as the Battle of the Bulge, caught senior Allied commanders flat-footed, and they scrambled to repulse the enemy&#x2019;s advance as Wehrmacht troops streamed out of the dense Ardennes Forest, decimating green American troops all along the front. Chased by panzer tanks, entire battalions fled from their positions while Allied commanders desperately tried to stem the retreat. Chaos reigned for several days, and accurate information was in high demand but short supply; defenses appeared to be crumbling all along the front.</p><h2>Angels in the Sky: How a Band of Volunteer Airmen Saved the New State of Israel</h2><p>In 1948, only three years after the Holocaust, the newly founded nation of Israel came under siege from a coalition of Arab states. The invaders vowed to annihilate the tiny country and its 600,000 settlers. A second Holocaust was in the making.<br>Outnumbered sixty to one, the Israelis had no allies, no regular army, no air force, no superpower to intercede on their behalf. The United States, Great Britain, and most of Europe enforced a strict embargo on the shipment of arms to the embattled country. In the first few days, the Arab armies overran Israel. The Egyptian air force owned the sky, making continuous air attacks on Israeli cities and army positions. Israel's extinction seemed certain.<br>And then came help. From the United States, Canada, Britain, France, South Africa arrived a band of volunteer airmen. Most were World War II veterans&#x2015;young, idealistic, swaggering, noble, eccentric, courageous beyond measure. Many were Jews, a third were not. Most of them knowingly violated their nations' embargoes on the shipment of arms and aircraft to Israel. They smuggled in Messerschmitt fighters from Czechoslovakia, painting over swastikas with Israeli stars. Defying their own countries' strict laws, the airmen risked everything&#x2015;their lives, careers, citizenship&#x2015;to fight for Israel.<br>They were a small group, fewer than 150. In the crucible of war they became brothers in a righteous cause. They flew, fought, died, and, against all odds, helped save a new nation. The saga of the volunteer airmen in Israel's war of independence stands as one of the most stirring&#x2015;and untold&#x2015;war stories of the past century.<br> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Robert Gandt is a former Navy fighter pilot, international airline captain, and the award-winning author of sixteen books on aviation and military subjects.

Ellis, a producer for National Public Radio, spent an unforgettable year traveling with her tape recorder and listening to the stories of America&#x2019;s oldest men and women. She met a couple who courted by horse and sleigh in Vermont during the winter of 1918, and she spent a week with the oldest living black lesbian in America. She visited a nationally known expert on dyslexia who published a book at 96 and whose great-great-grandfather was a colonel in Washington&#x2019;s army; and she met Anna Wilmot, the row-boating centenarian from New England who captured the hearts of thousands of NPR listeners with her confession that she swims in the buff only &#x201c;when it&#x2019;s foggy and there&#x2019;s no fisherman around.&#x201d; <br><br> Originally conceived as an American history project, Ellis&#x2019;s year of interviews became much more, a personal journey of growth and transformation. After two decades of acting as the reporter and inquisitor, Ellis finally shifted gears and was able in the process of these conversations to start really listening. Once she had put away the exigencies of her cusp-of-the-millennium life&#x2014;her deadlines, the intense focus on current events, the endless e-mail and ringing phones&#x2014;she began to learn the kinds of things that we do from much older people. She started to connect in her conversations with them, and to see the virtue of looking forward, as the centenarians did, not backward. They reminded her that the moment&#x2014;this very moment that we&#x2019;re in right now&#x2014;is precious and fine. And that the true richness of life is to be found in each other&#x2014;in our marriages and friendships, in the intellectual life that we share with each other, and in the ways that we become connected. Their stories add up to a course in living well, with lessons and inspiration for all of us.</p><p>NEENAH ELLIS, formerly a staff producer for NPR&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>All Things Considered</i>, is the general manager of public radio station WYSO in Yellow Springs Ohio, where she lives with her husband, Noah Adams.1<br><br> <b>Victoria Williams<br> </b><br> "You people have so much fun now."<br><br> Victoria Williams, at 106 years old, was the size of a twelve-year-old girl. They brought her to me in a wheelchair. On the seat next to her was a black vinyl pocketbook, its stiff handle placed up over her shoulder. Her lips were pressed tight together. She was angry.<br><br> The health aide pushing the chair rolled her eyes as she approached me in the visitors lounge and said in a low voice, "We've had a rough morning."<br><br> "Miss Williams, would you like a cookie?" she said, coming around to the front of the chair.<br><br> "I want coffee," said Victoria Williams, loudly. The woman walked off without introducing us.<br><br> "Good morning," I said in my most chipper voice. Victoria Williams stared at me like a bug, expressionless. I leaned toward her. There was a faint smell of urine.<br><br> "I'm the reporter who's come to interview you."<br><br> "Interview me?"<br><br> "For radio. I just want to ask you some questions about your life."<br><br> Victoria Williams was the first centenarian I met. I had applied for a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to interview centenarians and I needed a sample tape, to give the review panel an idea of what my radio series might sound like. I was in a hurry; the deadline was soon.<br><br> I called the Washington Center for Aging Services, a huge home for the elderly in Northeast D.C. It's not the kind of place I would choose to live in. The aides seemed caring but stretched hopelessly beyond their means. I was taken to a lounge area where residents sat silently, some watching television, some in a stupor.<br><br> I was not surprised to find myself there for the first interview. It matched my stereotypes and I thought, This is what happens when you're old if you have no place else to go. I expected to see many more places like this. I also expected, at that time, that most centenarians would be like Victoria Williams.<br><br> The skin on her face was smooth and shiny and taut. She jutted her jaw, sliding her false teeth forward and then back, inspecting me, shifting her attention away from her struggle with the aide, whatever it had been.<br><br> "Here's your coffee, Miss Williams." The aide returned with a steaming Styrofoam cup and two chocolate-chip cookies on a napkin. Evidently, it was a peace offering, and it was accepted.<br><br> With her elbows on the armrests and her dark, bony fingers wrapped delicately around the cup, Victoria Williams held the coffee beneath her nose, inhaling the vapor.<br><br> "My mother and father died and we had to go to work," she started in abruptly, without looking up.<br><br> "You went to work after they passed on?"<br><br> "Part-time? No! We didn't no part-time, we worked if it was all day or all night."<br><br> I shifted closer to her right ear so she could hear me better.<br><br> She sipped the coffee loudly and said, "Ooh, that's hot!" Then she continued: "We had to work all the time. Didn't no place stay and pay no rent. No! We worked! We stay where we worked."<br><br> She put the edge of the cookie between her teeth and broke off a piece, chewing as she talked, not looking at me.<br><br> "You people have so much fun now."<br><br> I wasn't sure whom she meant.<br><br> "You think people have more fun now?"<br><br> "Yeah, you all have a lot of fun, setting down and drinking coffee that somebody make and give you. You didn't make and give us none. We had to make our own."<br><br> "Miss Williams, do you remember when you were a little girl?"<br><br> "A little girl."<br><br> "Do you remember?"<br><br> "When?"<br><br> "When you were a girl. Do you remember?"<br><br> "Yeaaaahh." She dragged out the word and smiled.<br><br> "What was it like when you were a little girl?"<br><br> "We used to know a lot of little girls in our day," she said.<br><br> "No, I mean when you were a little girl."<br><br> "I was in school. There were a lot of little girls."<br><br> "Where did you go to school?"<br><br> "Wherever Mother worked, if it wasn't too far for us to walk, we'd go in that school."<br><br> "You walked to school?"<br><br> "Yeah. The teachers were nice to us, too. There weren't no nasty teachers."<br><br> "What did you learn in school, what did you study?"<br><br> "Studied everything. Graduated. Mmm-hmm. Teachers were nice to us."<br><br> Before long it became clear that Victoria Williams could tell only one story about herself and she kept coming back to it, as if it were a tape playing in her mind: She graduated from high school and then from Hampton Institute in Virginia, one of the country's first black universities, and then she taught school. She got work because she was highly recommended. People respected her parents, who were honest and hardworking, so she had "good backing" and got good jobs. She kept coming back to parts of this story no matter what question I asked. Often she would break into a remembered conversation, speaking both parts.<br><br> I asked her, "Where was your daddy from?"<br><br> "My daddy's son?"<br><br> "No, where was he from?"<br><br> "When did he . . . ?"<br><br> "Where was he born?"<br><br> "Where? I forgot. My daddy was born somewhere in New York or New Jersey. My mother was a teacher. She cooked and washed and ironed and taught school, too, so she had a good recommendation."<br><br> "Do you know where your mother was born?"<br><br> "Yeah! She was born down in North Carolina."<br><br> "And where were you born?"<br><br> "North Carolina."<br><br> "What town?"<br><br> "Near Hampton Institute. That was the hospital where people used to go in. People didn't have their babies out in the street. You'd have your baby in the hospital with a doctor, and when the baby's born, the doctor would say, 'She was a healthy child,' and they'd take you right in school. So the background helps to push you. Yeah. And then you get you another teacher and you do pretty good. 'Well, where did you learn that?' 'I learned that at such and such a school.' 'Oh, you went to more than one school?' 'Yes I did!'"<br><br> After an hour or so, I began to feel frustrated, deciding that I couldn't have a real exchange of ideas with Victoria Williams. There would be no stories from the early part of the century, only fragments of memories that I had no hope of putting in context. I'd just try to get some good one-liners and leave. Luckily, though, the health aide was listening in and had more patience than I.<br><br> "When you were coming up, when you were a little girl, did you hear much about slavery?" she asked Miss Williams.<br><br> "We didn't know much about slavery. We learned about the college part of a colored person. No indeed, we were above that! Yes. Mmm-hmm. He has to either be in college or have finished. He can't be out in the street. You can't teach him nothin' in the street. You can help him after he got in college."<br><br> In my deaf impatience, I failed to realize the richness of this question and changed the subject.<br><br> "Miss Williams, do you remember when you came to Washington?"<br><br> After a couple of hours, I said good-bye. The interview had mostly been a failure. I had no coherent stories and only a vague idea of what her life had been like.<br><br> A couple of days later I interviewed another lady; this one had only just turned one hundred.<br><br> "Rochelle" had a small, sunny apartment in an assisted-living facility. She was high-spirited and bossy but sweet, too, and a little loopy the day I met her. She assumed she knew what questions I had and insisted on telling me right away why she had lived so long.<br><br> "Ever since I was a kid, I drew people like Bies and I still do. When I come down to dinner--I'm not showing off, I'm telling you the truth--there's a lineup that passes me. Honest to God, I'm not lying to you. People admire the hundred age, but people have always been drawn to me. That's one thing I can really boast about. I always had friends."<br><br> She seemed nervous and impatient, and wanted to get this over with. I raced through a list of questions I had prepared in an effort to do a better interview than I had with Victoria Williams. The questions involved most of the major historical events of the twentieth century. But Rochelle had a fuzzy memory for some things. She couldn't remember the difference between World War I and World War II.<br><br> "Oh, now I'm confused," she said, her hands buttering above her lap, but with some prompting, she did recall the end of World War I. She was living in New York at the time.<br><br> "I remember the excitement. People went out in the street, they were so happy! They were so happy!"<br><br> Her eyes suddenly welled up.<br><br> "It brings tears to my eyes. That I remember distinctly. I was married by that time. I remember them rejoicing when the war was over."<br><br> She surprised me. One moment she seemed scattered and confused, the next moment she cried. I didn't know where to go from there.<br><br> "Tell me about your husband," I asked.<br><br> "Ahhh, that's a story in itself. There isn't much to tell. I fell in love because of his kiss. I fell in love immediately; nothing else mattered. And now, in my old age, I take inventory."<br><br> She leaned forward conspiratorily and mouthed the word "Nothing!"<br><br> She leaned back and paused. "I'd rather you wouldn't write about my husband. I thought I loved him. It was just a physical attraction. But," she said, "we were very happy. We had two beautiful children."<br><br> I could not imagine telling a stranger such a thing. I hadn't been with her more than twenty minutes. I think part of her was upset that she had revealed so much.<br><br> Rochelle said, "My mind is going. I can sense it. I don't know what happens. I become confused. I don't know what the hell I'm doing half the time."<br><br> Rochelle was aware that she was losing control and it made her agitated in conversation with a stranger. The walls of her apartment were covered with photos of her children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and I felt glad to know she was surrounded by people who loved her, who knew her story, who didn't care whether she could remember the difference between World War I and World War II. My presence was a reminder that she had changed and I made her uneasy.<br><br> From those two first encounters I learned to be more patient, to spend more time. But I took those interviews and made my sample tape for the grant proposal. I chose a recording of a bittersweet Scott Joplin piano piece and played the edited tape cuts over that, with the non sequiturs edited out.<br><br> I won the grant. I promised to interview twenty centenarians around the country, but I would need a better strategy. I needed to get them to tell me stories instead of one-liners. I knew how to do this, I'd been doing it for twenty years, but never with people who had so many difficulties. The dementia, especially, was a new factor and I expected to encounter it repeatedly.<br><br> I would have to relearn what I knew about interviewing, and I would have to edit these interviews in a way that would make the centenarians sound coherent without completely misrepresenting their mental condition.<br><br> The sample tape had a pleasant enough sound to it, but I did leave in a hint of Victoria Williams's disorganized mind.<br><br> "Miss Williams, I see you have your purse with you."<br><br> "Yeah, I carry it everywhere I go. That's my driving permit and things. Because I might run into something."<br><br> "You still driving?"<br><br> "Yeah. And if someone said, 'You have a driving permit?' 'Certainly, I do.'"<br><br> "Do you still have your car?"<br><br> "Yeah. I have a car. Mmm-hmm."<br><br> "You did have a car."<br><br> "I do have a car, but I don't need it, so I leave it for my mother to drive."</p><h2>Lincoln&#39;s Grave Robbers (Scholastic Focus)</h2><p>A true crime thriller -- the first book for teens to tell the nearly unknown tale of the brazen attempt to steal Abraham Lincoln's body!<br><br>The action begins in October of 1875, as Secret Service agents raid the Fulton, Illinois, workshop of master counterfeiter Ben Boyd. Soon after Boyd is hauled off to prison, members of his counterfeiting ring gather in the back room of a smoky Chicago saloon to discuss how to spring their ringleader. Their plan: grab Lincoln's body from its Springfield tomb, stash it in the sand dunes near Lake Michigan, and demand, as a ransom, the release of Ben Boyd --and $200,000 in cash. From here, the action alternates between the conspirators, the Secret Service agents on their trail, and the undercover agent moving back and forth between the two groups. Along the way readers get glimpses into the inner workings of counterfeiting, grave robbing, detective work, and the early days of the Secret Service. The plot moves toward a wild climax as robbers and lawmen converge at Lincoln's tomb on election night: November 7, 1876.</p><p>Steve Sheinkin is the recipient of the YASLA award for Excellence in Nonfiction.

Rubin, a pioneering theorist and activist in feminist, lesbian and gay, queer, and sexuality studies since the 1970s. Rubin first rose to prominence in 1975 with the publication of &#x201c;The Traffic in Women,&#x201d; an essay that had a galvanizing effect on feminist thinking and theory. In another landmark piece, &#x201c;Thinking Sex,&#x201d; she examined how certain sexual behaviors are constructed as moral or natural, and others as unnatural. That essay became one of queer theory&#x2019;s foundational texts. Along with such canonical work, <i>Deviations</i> features less well-known but equally insightful writing on subjects such as lesbian history, the feminist sex wars, the politics of sadomasochism, crusades against prostitution and pornography, and the historical development of sexual knowledge. In the introduction, Rubin traces her intellectual trajectory and discusses the development and reception of some of her most influential essays. Like the book it opens, the introduction highlights the major lines of inquiry pursued for nearly forty years by a singularly important theorist of sex, gender, and culture.</p><p><p>Gayle S.

[I]t is clarifying to read Rubin's analyses, still germane, direct and sharp after all these years.

Yet there have always been white people involved in fighting racism. In this passionate work, Becky Thompson looks at white Americans who have struggled against racism, offering examples of both successes and failures, inspirations, practical philosophies, and a way ahead. <p>A Promise and a Way of Life weaves an account of the past half-century based on the life histories of thirty-nine people who have placed antiracist activism at the center of their lives. Through a rich and fascinating narrative that links individual experiences with social and political history, Thompson shows the ways, both public and personal, in which whites have opposed racism during several social movements: the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, multiracial feminism, the Central American peace movement, the struggle for antiracist education, and activism against the prison industry. Beginning with the diverse catalysts that started these activists on their journeys, this book demonstrates the contributions and limitations of white antiracism in key social justice movements. </p><p>Through these stories, crucial questions are raised: Does antiracist work require a repudiation of one's whiteness or can that identity be transformed through political commitment and alliances? What do white people need to do to undermine white privilege? What would it take to build a multiracial movement in which white people are responsible for creating antiracist alliances while not co-opting people of color? </p><p>Unique in its depth and thoroughness, A Promise and a Way of Life is essential for anyone currently fighting racism or wondering how to do so. Through its demonstration of the extraordinary personal and social transformations ordinary people can make, it provides a new paradigm for movement activity, one that will help to incite and guide future antiracist activism. </p><p>Becky Thompson is associate professor of sociology at Simmons College. She is the author of Mothering without a Compass (2000) and A Hunger So Wide and So Deep (1994), both published by Minnesota.</p></p><p>Thompson is associate professor of sociology at Simmons College."I think it pisses God off," says Shug to Celie in Alice Walker's The Color Purple, "if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it." Simmons College sociology professor Thompson (Mothering Without a Compass, Forecasts, Oct. 2, 2000) uses this metaphor of unappreciated reality to describe how centuries of political resistance by African-American, Latino and Asian activists has allowed white activists as well as academics pursuing the emerging discipline of "whiteness studies" to undertake social and critical antiracist work. After spending six years interviewing nearly 40 women and men who see themselves as part of a multiracial and multi-issue antiracism movement, Thompson delivers a fascinating, groundbreaking study of the longstanding role and ongoing struggles of antiracist political work in U.S. progressive culture. Examining the spectrum of political activism including the Black Power movement, prison activism, multiracial lesbian-feminism, the Sanctuary movement, the New Left and the Weather Underground and issues of spirituality and activism, Thompson sensitively navigates the myriad concerns, complications and contradictions of each movement (and their interactions with one another). Mapping a complicated but robust aspect of U.S. progressive politics with subtlety and exacting honesty, Thompson makes an important addition to the current popular literature on race, whiteness and feminism. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Umineko WHEN THEY CRY Episode 8: Twilight of the Golden Witch, Vol. 1 (Umineko WHEN THEY CRY, 19)</h2><p>It&#39;s time once again for the annual family gathering on Rokkenjima!

This book looks afresh at the conflict in Northern Africa, focusing for the first time on the involvement of the US and the way this early collaboration to defeat shaped the whole Anglo-American axis for the rest of the war in Europe. By June 1942, Britain had reached her lowest ebb. Her military command was in tatters, her armies beaten, and in the Middle East it seemed all might be lost. Her new ally, America, had only fledgling armed forces and was severely under-trained, yet it was this alliance of the weary combatant and naive newcomer, coming together for the first time in North Africa, that would eventually bring about the defeat of Nazi Germany. This crucial period - from defeat at Gazala through to the victories of Alamein and, ultimately, Tunisia - was a time of learning for the Allies. Yet by the end Britain and America had finally gained material and certain tactical advantages over Germany, particularly in air warfare. As this book shows, the development of a tactical air force - principles that are still used to this day - were founded over the skies of North Africa. When the Axis forces were finally driven from North Africa in May 1943, over 250,000 Axis troops were taken prisoner, more than had surrendered to the Russians at Stalingrad. It was a major victory and a crucial steppingstone to the future invasion of Italy and France. In this new reappraisal, James Holland interweaves the personal stories of the men - and women - who made up these polyglot Allied forces: British and American, Nepalese and Punjabi, South African and Australian, Maori and Zulu, from all ranks and all services. From the heat and dust of the Western Desert to the mud and mountains of Northern Tunisia, this book charts the extraordinary first days of an Alliance that has worked together ever since.</p><p>James Holland was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and studied history at Durham University. He has worked for several London publishing houses and has written for a number of national newspapers and magazines. He is the author of Fortress Malta: An Island Under Siege, 1940-1943, and a novel, The Burning Blue. Married with a son, he lives near Salisbury.&#39;Anyone who wants to know how it felt to fight in the desert war should read Holland&#39;s book.

These ancient teachings call us to turn primary attention to the Sacred Web of Life, of which we are a part and with which we are so obviously entangled.<br> &nbsp;<br> This quality of attention&#x2014;paying attention to the whole&#x2014;is called among my people &#x201c;holiness.&#x201d; Holiness is never understood to be focusing attention on a white-bearded old man figure as God, or on any specific spiritual figure, but rather enlarging our awareness to consciously include and respectfully consider All That Is, All Our Relations&#x2014;all beings, energies, and things in the larger Circle of Life.<br> &nbsp;<br> This sacred focus on holiness as an integral part of everyday life is central to Native American teachings, and is of great value to us today. White Buffalo Calf Pipe Woman, the mystical woman who came long, long ago to bring the sacred pipe as a symbol and reminder of the holiness, stands today as a central figure in the spiritual way of the Lakota Sioux and many other native tribes. The symbolism of the two men in the story of White Buffalo Woman told in the Prologue, as well as her pipe and teachings, are clear metaphors about how we are to approach life on Mother Earth if we two-leggeds&#x2014;we humans&#x2014;are to make it through this next century and create a new way of being on Earth that will open us to our full human-ness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Central to White Buffalo Woman&#x2019;s message, and to all native spirituality, is also the understanding that the Great Spirit lives in all things, enlivens all forms, and gives energy to all things in all realms of creation&#x2014;including Earthly life. Several things follow from this understanding:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2023; We, and all things in the web of life, are related. We are not only children of our Mother Earth, but also of our Father, the Great Spirit. And thus we are all each other&#x2019;s brothers and sisters.<br> &#x2023; Primary to our beingness, and to our relationships in the larger hoop, is the feminine energy of nurturing and renewing&#x2014;of ourselves, each other, and all those peoples in our Sacred Circle of Life, especially the children.<br> &#x2023; Each of us has Spirit within us to develop and bring forward. Each thing and being contains Spirit&#x2019;s living flame&#x2014;consciousness and aliveness&#x2014;and thus has the right to be respected and honored for its unique power and gift.<br> &#x2023; Through each of us Spirit can speak, and thus guide us and our people.<br> &#x2023; Each of us is a small, yet significant part of the wholeness and at the same time contains the wholeness. As in a hologram, where each piece contains the whole picture yet the picture becomes clearer as more and more pieces are joined together, so our harmony, unity, and cooperation with All Our Relations are necessary for the full picture of life to be revealed. It is only through this harmony that we will be able to move forward.<br> &#x2023; Our participation with the Great Creator in the continuing unfoldment of life is essential. Thus, renewal dances, such as the Corn Dance among the Pueblo peoples of the Southwest, and the Sun Dance among the Plains peoples; the harvest dances and honoring dances of other peoples in the Circle of Life, such as animal dances; plus all the other ceremonies honoring the cycles of the seasons and of life, are both our duty and our joy. These rituals focus participants toward the unfolding unity that can create life anew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Interestingly enough, the various native tribes or groups practiced these principles within their own group and with Mother Nature, yet they seldom extended this practice to other groups or tribes. A unified dance of all people, a rainbow dance of creation, did not occur to them. This is why the sacred dream of the Lakota visionary, Black Elk, was so important. When he was only nine years old, in the late 1800s, he had a vision of all races and colors dancing together to renew the Tree of Life. (This story is told in Black Elk Speaks by John Neihardt.) He was so uncomfortable with what had been revealed to him that he did not even speak of it until later in his life when urged to do so by an elder. Yet Black Elk&#x2019;s vision of a universal, global dance of creation and celebration that will be required in order for life to continue is absolutely vital to us all in this present day. In fact, we must not only renew the dances of creation, we must also extend them to include All Our Relations. This is the task before us, and it cannot be completed &#x201c;until we all join in a joyful dance of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> In our process of transforming and healing ourselves and the world in the present, it seems important that we understand something of our place in North American history. We need to know where we are and who we are being called to be, whether or not we are Native American. Let us first look at one of the structures used by many early native peoples as they attempted to create a peaceful and harmonious life.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the earliest times, our native people have had councils&#x2014;often comprised of all males or all females&#x2014;each holding a powerful focus of energy for the people. In many tribes, the men had an impressive war council&#x2014;but they also had a peace council as well. During the latter years of the fighting between Indians and whites in the late 1800s, the finest of our Native prophets began to receive information from Spirit. They were told that their people must make peace and eventually come into spiritual unity with the oppressors, in order for anyone&#x2014;most especially their own children of coming generations&#x2014;to have a good life, and for the Tree of Life to blossom again for all.<br> &nbsp;<br> At that time, the war councils and warrior societies, which were devoted to conflict and did not serve the people, essentially became obsolete. Our world was changing rapidly. The intention of Peace was set within the deep spirit of the Americas, and yet our struggle since then has been to make it real in our daily lives. The great prophets from time immemorial spoke to our people of returning to the oneness&#x2014;the brother/sisterhood that was modeled on this continent at the time of the great Sun centers in the South, when the Dawn Star walked among the people (see chapter 7). But for the most part, our Native people, as well as those from across the waters, engaged in divisiveness, warring, and separation, and in conflict over territory. Thus Indian and white alike were joined in a karmic endeavor to complete the warring and return finally to oneness and peace.<br> &nbsp;<br> To give an example, in his classic work, The Cheyennes, E. Adamson Hoebel speaks about the Cheyenne tribal council of peace chiefs. He explains:<br> &nbsp;<br> The keystone of the Cheyenne social structure is the tribal council of forty-four peace chiefs. War may be a major concern of the Cheyennes, and defense against the hostile Crow and Pawnee a major problem of survival, yet clearly the Cheyennes sense that a more fundamental problem is the danger of disintegration through internal dissension and aggressive impulses of Cheyenne against Cheyenne. Hence, the supreme authority of the tribe lies not in the hands of the aggressive war leaders but in the control of the even-tempered peace chiefs, all proven warriors.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet this peace council of male elders eventually failed to control the Bow Society, the warriors who wanted to go to war indiscriminately, without consulting their spiritual sources or the council of elders. In the subsequent fighting with other Indian tribes, a third of all the warriors and most of the chiefs on both sides were killed. The Sacred Bundle of Arrows&#x2014;the central sacred object of the tribe, representing masculine, procreative power&#x2014;was lost to the Cheyennes. Other serious physical and spiritual calamities befell them as well, all of which clearly pointed out the danger of indiscriminate warring, when what actually should have been happening was the making of peace and the nurturing of the people. Because of all this, the male Cheyenne peace council eventually lost its power and function.<br> &nbsp;<br> The message here is the primacy that the pursuit of peace and holiness must have in the minds, hearts, and actions of the people. In days of old, this concern extended only to those within the tribe. Now we have matured into a new time of understanding: we realize that peace and harmony must be generated not only within the entire family of two-leggeds but within the full Circle of Life as well.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Fire and Emergency Services Safety &amp; Survival</h2><p><i>Written with both students and career fire service professionals in mind, <b>Fire and Emergency Services Safety and Survival </b>incorporates the FESHE guidelines and outcomes for the Principles of Fire and Emergency Services Safety and Survival course</i> <br> <br> <b>Modern solutions, procedures, and recommendations that put safety first</b> <br>The Fire service has long been considered a profession plagued with a history of unavoidable tragedy.

In the third century BC Eratosthenes compiled a handbook of astral mythology in which the constellations were associated with figures from legend, and myths were provided to explain how each person, creature, or object came to be placed in the sky. Thus we can see Heracles killing the Dragon, and Perseus slaying the sea-monster to save Andromeda; Orion chases the seven maidens transformed by Zeus into the Pleiades, and Aries, the golden ram, is identified flying up to the heavens.<br> <br>This translation brings together the later summaries from Eratosthenes's lost handbook with a guide to astronomy compiled by Hyginus, librarian to Augustus. Together with Aratus's astronomical poem the <em>Phaenomena</em>, these texts provide a complete collection of Greek astral myths; imaginative and picturesque, they also offer an intriguing insight into ancient science and culture.<br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>For over 100 years <em>Oxford World's Classics</em> has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

The goal is to convey the most important concepts and principles at a level that is approachable for the widest possible audience. To achieve this goal, subjects are distilled down to its bare essentials (hence, the name of this book), while retaining a decidedly modern approach to finance. Also, understanding the "why" is just as important, if not more so, than understanding the "how" - especially in an introductory course.<br><br>Readability and pedagogy are key. <i>Essentials</i> is written in a relaxed, conversational style that invites the students to join in the learning process rather than being a passive information absorber.

It contains significant ideas on justice, moral responsibility, family life, economic activity, and the political structure of the state--all matters of profound interest to us today. Hegel shows that genuine human freedom does not consist in doing whatever we please, but involves living with others in accordance with publicly recognized rights and laws. Hegel demonstrates that institutions such as the family and the state provide the context in which individuals can flourish and enjoy full freedom. He also demonstrates that misunderstanding the true nature of freedom can lead to crime, evil, and poverty. His penetrating analysis of the causes of poverty in modern civil society was to be a great influence on Karl Marx. Hegel's study remains one of the most subtle and perceptive accounts of freedom that we possess, and this newly revised translation makes it more accessible than ever.

Drawn from her extensive travels throughout Cuba over the past decade, author L. Kaifa Roland pulls back the curtain on a country that has remained mysterious to Americans since the mid-twentieth century. Through vivid vignettes and firsthand details, Roland exposes the lasting effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent rise of state-sponsored segregated tourism in Cuba. She demonstrates how the creation of separate spheres for locals and tourists has had two effects. First, tourism reestablished the racial apartheid that plagued pre-revolutionary Cuba. Second, it reinforced how the state's desire to maintain a socialist ideology in face of its increasing reliance on capitalist tools is at odds with the day-to-day struggles--or <em>La Lucha</em>--of the Cuban people. Roland uses conversations and anecdotes gleaned from a year of living among locals as a way of delving into these struggles and understanding what constitutes life in Cuba today. In exploring the intersections of race, class, and gender, she gives readers a better understanding of the common issues of status and belonging for tourists and their hosts in Cuba.<br><br><em>Cuban Color in Tourism and </em>La Lucha is one of several volumes in the Issues of <strong>Globalization: Case Studies in Contemporary Anthropology </strong>series, which examines the experiences of individual communities in our contemporary world.

McNeill Alexander, <em>Nature</em></strong></p> Nature and humans build their devices with the same earthly materials and use them in the same air and water, pulled by the same gravity. Why, then, do their designs diverge so sharply? Humans, for instance, love right angles, while nature's angles are rarely right and usually rounded. Our technology goes around on wheels&#x2015;and on rotating pulleys, gears, shafts, and cams&#x2015;yet in nature only the tiny propellers of bacteria spin as true wheels. Our hinges turn because hard parts slide around each other, whereas nature's hinges (a rabbit's ear, for example) more often swing by bending flexible materials. In this marvelously surprising, witty book, Steven Vogel compares these two mechanical worlds, introduces the reader to his field of biomechanics, and explains how the nexus of physical law, size, and convenience of construction determine the designs of both people and nature.&nbsp;"This elegant comparison of human and biological technology will forever change the way you look at each."&#x2015;Michael LaBarbera, <em>American Scientist</em> Illustrated</p><p>"Life is what biology's all about. Technology is something else altogether. Or so I believed before I got into a kind of biology that's about technology as well as life," begins biomechanics expert Steven Vogel in the preface to <i>Cats' Paws and Catapults</i>. Vogel examines the "mechanical worlds of nature and people" in such chapters as "The Stiff and the Soft" and "The Matter of Magnitude." Lots of line-drawing illustrations help readers understand the examples used to answer questions of animal and machine efficiency, design and repair. Vogel clearly loves the puzzles of biology--why, for instance, do daffodil stems bend at only one precise spot? This book is filled with intriguing answers to such hidden questions, and curious readers will eagerly dive into Vogel's investigations of whether nature or human design is superior and why the two technologies have diverged so much. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Steven Vogel (1940&#x2015;2015) was James B. Duke Professor of Biology at Duke University. He was a prolific author of popular works on the intersection of physics and biology such as Cats' Paws and Catapults and Prime Mover: A Natural History of Muscle.</p><h2>Bloodline: Tracing God&#39;s Rescue Plan from Eden to Eternity</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Skip&#x2019;s insights about the precious blood shed for mankind will prick your mind and touch your heart.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Franklin Graham</b><br> &nbsp;<br><b>Discover the Savior on Every Page of Scripture</b><br><br> You will find no greater theme in all the Bible than the scarlet thread of redemption.

Girl Bands. Ballet troupes. Convents. In all times and places, girls and women have come together in communities of vocation, of necessity, of support. <br><br>In <i>Witches,</i> Sam George-Allen explores how wherever women gather, magic happens. Female farmers change the way we grow our food. Online beauty communities democratize skin-care rituals. And more than any other demographic, it's teen girls that shape our culture. <br><br>Patriarchal societies have long been content to champion boys' clubs, while viewing groups that exclude men as sites of rivalry and suspicion. This deeply personal investigation takes us from our workplaces to our social circles, surveying our heroes, our outcasts, and ourselves, in order to dismantle the persistent and pernicious cultural myth of female isolation and competition . . . once and for all.</p><p><b>Sam George-Allen</b> is an Australian writer and musician. Her essays and cultural criticism have been published in the <i>Guardian,</i> the <i>Griffith Review</i>, the <i>Lifted Brow</i>, <i>LitHub,</i> and <i>Overland.</i> She lives in a village in Tasmania with her partner, a dog, a cat and five chickens. <i>Witches</i> is her first book.I started pulling tarot cards while writing this book. The writing was hard and I was filled with self-doubt, so I turned to the cards in the way I have always turned to the magical in times of crisis. I trusted them because I can&#x2019;t control them. Even when they told me bad news&#x2014;failure on the horizon, friends to be lost, the Wheel of Fortune in reverse&#x2014;they helped. <br><br>The germ of this book got into me in another time of turmoil. A few years ago, I found myself suddenly and furiously envious of another woman&#x2019;s success. It was like having an uncontrollable crush. I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about her: comparing myself to her, finding reasons to resent and dismiss her. It was very upsetting. Wasn&#x2019;t I supposed to be a feminist, the good kind, one who builds her sisters up rather than tearing them down? Why was my basest nature choosing this moment, as I was carving out a career writing about gender and women&#x2019;s work, to make itself known? I went to the cards again, and I pulled one for me, which I immediately forgot, and one for her: Justice, reversed. <br><br>It was an injustice, what I was doing, and what was happening to me. It felt unnatural to begrudge this person her happiness. It was making me miserable. I did not think I was born with thesefeelings in me, and when I took hold of that thread and pulled, the whole wicked tapestry started to come apart. I wasn&#x2019;t born with these feelings, but I had been feeling them, in one way or another, for a long time&#x2014;since I was a teenager, at least. I&#x2019;m still part of a society that neither likes nor trusts women, particularly when they&#x2019;re working together. Even though they may have changed, learned to disguise themselves, those seeds of loathing were still there. <br><br>I hate admitting it now, because it&#x2019;s other women who make my life what it is today: meaningful, complicated, challenging and rewarding. I have surrounded myself, by luck and by design, with women who ask a lot of me, who give a lot to me, who are willing to sit at my kitchen table and argue with me for hours until we both have straightened out how we see the world, how we think the world should be. I owe women a lot, just for the pleasure of being in their company. <br><br>In the first episode of the second season of the excellent Netflix series GLOW, a show that is, in many ways, about the things that women do together (and also about a bunch of female amateur wrestlers making a low-budget TV show called Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling), there&#x2019;s a moment that made me reach for my pen. The women have just returned from filming a title sequence at the mall, where they&#x2019;d hammed it up in character, Welfare Queen and Liberty Belle taking swipes at each other with bunches of shopping bags, Britannica and Beirut chasing each other around stands of sunglasses. They are standing in a group, laughing with one another, relaxed and excited about what they&#x2019;ve just made. The director, Sam (played by Marc Maron at his neurotic, curmudgeonly best), approaches."Hey," he says. "I don&#x2019;t like when you&#x2019;re in a clump, whispering." He gestures dismissively. "Spread out so I can see you." <br><br>I wrote it down. <i>Spread out so I can see you. </i>It&#x2019;s almost a joke&#x2014;but not quite. Maron&#x2019;s character doesn&#x2019;t like it when women are doing stuff he doesn&#x2019;t know about. He finds it unnerving. A lot of people do. <br><br>For those invested in maintaining the status quo, there&#x2019;s a lot to be gained from preventing women from getting together. A population that is divided, distracted and economically depressed is unable to demand to be released from oppression. Isolated women are easier to sell things to, easier to control, more easily compressed into the very few ways to acceptably be a woman. All this is made even easier if that woman is inculcated into a tradition of mistrusting others like her. For a long time, we&#x2019;ve lived in a culture that tries to spread us out so it can see us&#x2014;and so we can&#x2019;t see each other, except from the corners of our eyes.<br><br>We&#x2019;re taught to enjoy female rivalry. We look for and expect it. Celebrity feuds fuel the whole tabloid industry. The ongoing success of the many iterations of Real Housewives is predicated on the same principle. Films, books and magazines aimed at women all sell the same, sorry story of women competing with one another, often for the attention of men. And we buy it. In 2016, a study by several sociologists on feminine rivalry found that their young, female subjects &#x2018;constructed comparisons and competition among women as never-ending and seemingly natural&#x2019;. The narrative has become so ingrained as to appear spontaneous, immutable and as naturally occurring as the weather. It is simply the way things are. <br><br>So when women choose to align with one another, it takes us by surprise. We look at it sideways; like GLOW&#x2019;s director, we are suspicious. Suspicion often goes hand in hand with derision, because if you strip a group of their credibility, you strip them of their perceived threat, too. Consider the mockery of women-only spaces on university campuses, the dismissal of teenage fangirls, the smirking devaluation of all-girl music groups, the sneering contempt of writers and readers of romance fiction. Mothers and daughters are pitted against one another, persuaded to be jealous, to compete for the love and attention of the father/husband; sisters, similarly; friends are always kept at arm&#x2019;s length in case they should prove smarter, prettier, more successful; organisations of women are frumpy or frivolous, not to be associated with; artistic efforts by women are gimmicks. To be taken seriously one must be alone among men. <br><br>What is the threat that women in groups pose? There are shades in Sam&#x2019;s anxiety of Margaret Atwood&#x2019;s eternal&nbsp; observation&#x2014;men are afraid that women will laugh at them, while women are afraid that men will kill them&#x2014;but the truth is that women together are a fundamental force for change. The change has already begun; we are seeing it happen before our eyes. Beyonc�&#x2019;s all-woman touring band; Taylor Swift&#x2019;s famous girl squad; Parris Goebel&#x2019;s jaw-dropping dance troupe; and, of course, the many women, visible and invisible, who have become a part of the #MeToo movement, which has begun the hard&#x2014;and previously impossible&#x2014;work of toppling a crooked pyramid of corrupt and predatory men, a movement that repre-sents probably the greatest and most conspicuous collaboration of women since the suffragettes. In the wake of #MeToo, it becomes clear why those who benefit from the patriarchy have been so invested in keeping women isolated from one another. And these are just some of the feminine collaborations rising in the public consciousness. When I look at them, I feel my heart leap in an unfamiliar way. I see glimpses of how the world could be.</p><h2>Changes of Mind: A Holonomic Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness (SUNY Series in the Philosophy of Psychology)</h2><p><i>An original theory of the development of consciousness that brings together research from neurology, new-paradigm studies, psychology, and mysticism.</i><br><br>Changes of Mind unites literature from the new physics, brain research, developmental psychology, and mysticism to produce the first comprehensive theory of individual human consciousness.

The students at the prestigious prep school don't mix with locals; even within the school, hierarchy rules as freshman and faculty members find out where they fit in and what is expected from them. But there are minor collisions happening everywhere: An awkward boy, the son of a teacher, is flirting with a pretty classmate, the daughter of a convenience-store cashier. A photographer in plastic flip-flops and an overflowing backpack is about to marry a staid, ambitious historian. And when a body is found in the river behind the school, a local policeman named Abey Grey will walk into this enclosed world and upset it entirely...</p><p>There are two things any reader can count on when coming to Alice Hoffman: her prose and a remarkable empathy for those who live on the fringes of society. In her 13th novel, the author turns both to good account. Set in a tony private school located in a small New England town, <i>The River King</i> traces an intricate weave of intersecting lives over the course of a year. The Haddan School, founded in 1858, has long been the scene of tragedy and wonder: during its first year a tremendous storm flooded the grounds, and more than a century later "frogs can be found in the plumbing; linens and clothes stored in closets have a distinctly weedy odor, as if each article had been washed in river water and never thoroughly dried." Then there are the glorious roses planted by Annie Howe, a villager who married the headmaster and later hanged herself; these flowers have an unusual effect on sensitive girls. "When such girls walked past the brittle canes in the gardens behind St. Anne's, they felt something cold at the base of their spines, a bad case of pins and needles, as though someone were issuing a warning: be careful who you choose to love and who loves you in return."<p> A cogent warning indeed, for as in all of Hoffman's novels, the question of whom one chooses to love and who loves in return is the crux of the matter. <i>The River King</i> revolves around triangles. First there is Betsy Chase, a young photography teacher at the Haddan School who has gotten herself engaged--almost accidentally--to a fellow faculty member, even as she is inexorably drawn to Abel Grey, a town policeman. Then there are Carlin Leander, a scholarship student, and her best friend, Gus Pierce. While Carlin is able to fit in, even attracting the interest of the most popular boy on campus, Gus is a defiant outcast, a tall skinny kid in a long black overcoat "who viewed his own life as a prison sentence and experienced his existence much as a condemned man might." Carlin's romance with the charismatic, cruel Harry McKenna creates a rupture between her and Gus, and fuels a mean-spirited practical joke with horrific consequences. In the aftermath of tragedy, each character's heart, conscience, and courage is tested in unexpected ways.</p><p> Hoffman spins her web of love and heartbreak and transcendence with a sure hand, and in the process creates characters so palpably human in all their petty flaws and small instances of heroism that one almost expects them to step out of the book and into the room. Indeed, if there is a flaw in <i>The River King</i>, it is that Alice Hoffman doesn't always trust the magic inherent in her characters, relying a little too heavily at times on somewhat precious invocations of the otherworldly. But this is a minor defect in an otherwise satisfying novel, one that will keep the reader spellbound by its emotional complexity and compelling story. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>Alice Hoffman</b>&nbsp;is the author of more than thirty works of fiction, including <i>The Rules of Magic</i>, <i>Practical Magic</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Marriage of Opposites</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Red Garden</i>, the Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club selection&nbsp;<i>Here on Earth</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Museum of Extraordinary Things</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Dovekeepers</i>.

But for the next forty years, the University of Washington dominated rowing around the world. <br><br>The secret of the Huskies' success was George Pocock, a soft-spoken English immigrant raised on the banks of the Thames.

As rowers from the University of Washington went on to become coaches at major universities across the country, Pocock's philosophy&#x2015;and his shells&#x2015;became nationally famous in the world of crew. <br><br>Drawing on documents provided by Pocock's family, photographs from the University of Washington Crew Archives, and interviews with rowers who revered the man, Newell evokes the times as well as the life of this unique figure in American sport.</p><p>The late <b>Gordon Newell</b> was the author of several books on maritime history, including <i>Pacific Tugboats</i> and<i> Mighty Mo, The </i>U.S.S. Missouri:<i> A Biography of the Last Battleship</i>. The late <b>Dick Erickson</b> was University of Washington varsity crew coach from 1968 to 1987."As a youth in Britain, Pocock learned the rudiments of boat building from his father, who crafted boats for young Etonians. Forced to emigrate by straitened economic conditions, he journeyed to the Pacific Northwest intending to find work as a lumberjack. Fortunately for the University of Washington in Seattle, he was persuaded to establish shop there and began making shells of outstanding quality. They were so good, in fact, that Washington won its first intercollegiate title in 1923, defeating the Eastern teams that had ruled the sport for decades. One of his greatest triumphs occurred in 1936 when the Washington team won an Olympic gold medal in Germany, but he had numerous other successes as both boatman and coach until his retirement in 1963. There are many fine photos, including some of special interest from the 19th century, and a foreword by the coach of Washington's varsity crew."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Family Shaped by Grace</h2><p>"Gary Morland is a gifted communicator who has learned many lessons the hard way. &nbsp;He grew up in a dysfunctional family and went down that road himself, bottoming out as a confused alcoholic with a wife, two daughters, and no idea how to change.

They are coming toward the village even now,&#x201d; William called.<br><br>Clare paused in the middle of a detailed discussion of the best method for extracting oil of roses. &#x201c;I beg your pardon, madam,&#x201d; she said to Prioress Margaret.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Margaret was a stoutly built woman of middle years. The wimple of her black Benedictine habit framed sharp eyes and gently rounded features. &#x201c;This is an important event.&#x201d;<br><br>Clare turned to see young William hopping about in great excitement near the convent gatehouse. He waved his bag of gingered currants at her.<br><br>A plump, brown-haired, dark-eyed lad of ten, he was a good-natured combination of lively curiosity and unquenchable enthusiasm. He and his mother, Lady Joanna, had come to live on the Isle of Desire three years earlier. Clare was very fond of both of them. As her own family had dwindled down to nothing, leaving her alone in the world, she had grown very close to William and Joanna.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is here, William?&#x201d; Clare braced herself for the answer. Every inhabitant on Desire, with the exception of herself, had been eagerly anticipating this day for weeks. She was the only one who was not looking forward to the selection of a new lord for Desire.<br><br>At least she was to have a choice of husbands, she reminded herself. That was more than many women in her position got.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis the first of the suitors you said Lord Thurston would send.&#x201d; William stuffed a handful of gingered currants into his mouth. &#x201c;They say he appears to be a most powerful knight, Lady Clare. He brings a fine, great host of men-at-arms. I heard John Blacksmith say that it took half the boats in Seabern to get all the men and horses and baggage from the mainland to our island.&#x201d;<br><br>A curious flutter of uneasiness made Clare catch her breath. She had promised herself that when the time came, she would be calm and businesslike about the matter. But now that the moment was upon her, she was suddenly vastly more anxious than she had thought to be.<br><br>&#x201c;A great host?&#x201d; Clare frowned.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; William&#x2019;s face glowed. &#x201c;The sunlight on their helms is so bright, it hurts your eyes.&#x201d; He gulped down two more fistfuls of the currants. &#x201c;And the horses are huge. There is one in particular, John says, a great gray stallion with hooves that will shake the very earth when he goes past.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I did not request a great number of knights and men-at-arms,&#x201d; Clare said. &#x201c;Desire requires only a small company of men to protect our shipments. What on earth am I to do with a large number of warriors underfoot? And all their horses, too. Men and horses eat a great deal of food, you know.<br><br>&#x201c;Do not fret, Clare.&#x201d; Margaret smiled. &#x201c;Young William&#x2019;s notion of a vast host of fighting men is likely very different from our own. Keep in mind that the only company of armed men that he has ever seen is Sir Nicholas&#x2019;s small household force at Seabern.&#x201d;<br><br>I trust that you are right, madam.&#x201d; Clare lifted the fragrant pomander that hung from a chain on her girdle and inhaled the soothing blend of roses and herbs. The scent comforted her, as it always did. &#x201c;Nevertheless, it will be a great nuisance having to feed and house so many men and horses. By Saint Hermione&#x2019;s ear, I do not like the notion of having to entertain all of these people. And this is only the first of the candidates.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Calm yourself, Clare,&#x201d; Margaret said. &#x201c;Mayhap the crowd that has disembarked down at the harbor is composed of more than one suitor. The three or four you ordered may have arrived all at the same time. That would explain why there are so many men and horses.&#x201d;<br><br>Clare cheered at the notion. &#x201c;Aye, that must be it.&#x201d; She dropped the small pomander so that it dangled once more amid the folds of her gown. &#x201c;All my suitors have arrived together. If they have each brought their own entourages, that would explain the large number of men and horses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d;<br><br>Another thought along the same lines struck Clare, one which immediately wiped away her momentary relief. &#x201c;I do hope they will not stay long. It will cost a fortune to feed them all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can afford it, Clare.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the point. At least, not entirely.&#x201d;<br><br>Margaret&#x2019;s eyes twinkled. &#x201c;Once you have made your selection from among the candidates, the others, including their men and retainers, will take their leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By Hermione&#x2019;s sainted toe, I shall choose quickly, then, so that we do not waste any more food and hay on this lot than is absolutely necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A wise plan.&#x201d; Margaret eyed her closely. &#x201c;Are you so very anxious, my child?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, of course not,&#x201d; Clare lied. &#x201c;Merely eager to get the matter concluded. There is work to be done. I cannot afford to waste a great deal of time on this business of selecting a husband. I trust Lord Thurston has only sent me candidates who meet all of my requirements.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he has,&#x201d; Margaret murmured. &#x201c;You were most specific in your letter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d; Clare had spent hours formulating her recipe for a new lord of Desire.<br><br>Those hours had been spent after she had wasted even more time concocting dozens of clever reasons why she did not need a husband. To that end, she had called upon all the skills of rhetoric, logic, and debate that Margaret had taught her. She had been well aware that if she was to avoid the inevitable, she would need to give Lord Thurston a truly brilliant excuse for refusing marriage.<br><br>Clare had tried out each finely reasoned argument first on Joanna and then on Prioress Margaret before committing it to parchment. Sympathetic to the cause, both of the women had considered the string of carefully crafted excuses one after the other, offering criticism and advice.<br><br>In the months since her father&#x2019;s death, Clare had been developing what she was certain was an absolutely unassailable, logically graceful argument against the necessity of marriage based on the naturally secure position of the Isle of Desire when disaster had struck.<br><br>Her neighbor on the mainland, Sir Nicholas of Seabern, had wrecked the endeavor by kidnapping her while she was on a short visit to Seabern.<br><br>Furious with Nicholas because he had ruined everything by providing clear evidence of her personal vulnerability, Clare had proceeded to make life at Seabern Keep a living hell for him. By the end of her enforced stay, Nicholas confessed himself glad to see the last of her.<br><br>But it was too late.<br><br>Coming as it did on top of the increased predations of the robbers who infested the region, the kidnapping was the last stone in the sack. Clare knew that it was only a matter of time before Lord Thurston heard the rumors. He would conclude that she was incapable of protecting Desire and he would act at once to see to the matter himself.<br><br>Outraged and frustrated by events as she was, Clare had to admit she could not entirely blame Thurston for taking such a course of action. In his position, she would have done the same. The portion of the revenues to which he was entitled as Desire&#x2019;s liege lord were too plump and healthy to be put at risk.<br><br>And Clare could not risk the lives of the men from the village who accompanied the shipments of perfume. Sooner or later, the robbers were going to kill someone when they attacked.<br><br>In truth, she had no choice and she knew it. She had a duty and an obligation to the people of Desire. Her mother, who had died when Clare was twelve, had taught her from the cradle that the wishes of the lady of the manor came second to the needs of her people and the lands that sustained them.<br><br>Clare knew full well that although she possessed the skills to keep Desire a fat and profitable estate, she was no trained warrior.<br><br>There were no household knights, nor even any men-at-arms left on Desire. The few who had once lived in the hall had dispersed over the years. Some had accompanied her brother Edmund to the tournaments and had not returned to the isle after he had been killed. Desire, after all, was not a very exciting place. It did not suit young knights and squires who were eager for glory and the profits to be made competing in the endless round of tournaments or by going on Crusade.</p><h2>Nova Express: The Restored Text</h2><p>The most ferociously political and prophetic book of Burroughs's "cut-up" trilogy, <i>Nova Express</i> fires the reader into a textual outer space the better to see our burning planet and the operations of the Nova Mob in all their ugliness.

Are you considering changing to liturgical tradition? Are you already immersed in liturgical worship but want to grasp its deeper significance? <i>Beyond Smells and Bells</i> addresses the lure and relevance of liturgy for your life today.</p><p>Thousands of Christians become interest in liturgy each year for the first time, as they turn to orthodoxy, tradition, and the lasting rituals of the Christian faith. In a culture that values spontaneity, liturgy grounds us in something enduring. In a culture that assumes truth is a product of the mind, liturgy helps us experience truth in mind, body, and spirit. In Mark Galli's able telling, liturgy is an intruguing story, full of mystery, that transforms us.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Galli</b>&nbsp;is senior managing editor of&nbsp;<i>Christianity Today.</i>&nbsp;He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Francis of Assisi and His World</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Jesus Mean and Wild: The Unexpected Love of an Untamable God</i>. He is a graduate of Fuller Theological Seminary and has been worshiping in the Anglican tradition for nearly 20 years, most recently as a member of Church of the Ressurection in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.</p>At a time when magazines and journals are documenting the upsurge of interest in liturgy and ritual, a book from the senior managing editor of <i>Christianity Today</i> would seem well-timed. Unfortunately Galli, trying to cover all the bases from Eastern Orthodox to Presbyterian in exploring how liturgy helps to cultivate God's people, speaks too broadly and generically for an audience that is just discovering and trying to fathom formal worship traditions. Galli thoughtfully addresses the way in which liturgy shapes us in general, by changing our focus, sense of time and culture. But the lack of specific examples (in an effort to be inclusive) leaves readers with theory that may be difficult to translate into Sunday morning worship. However, Galli's love of the liturgy is clear, and his own stories of the way it has engaged and changed him over time are informative. The book's three appendixes (a glossary of common liturgical terms, a comparison of the order of worship in various traditions and a description of the seasons of the Christian year) will be helpful to newcomers to church traditions. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And where is the mysterious yellow dog?</p><p>In this brilliant comic narrative,<i> Emotionally Weird</i>, which explores the nonsensical power of language and meaning, Kate Atkinson has created another magical masterpiece.</p></p><p>Readers who survive the first 20 pages of this dense and playful novel, with its three different openings, constant jokes, and crowded cast of characters, will find themselves rewarded with a leisurely postmodern romp through the student ferment and bodily indulgences of the early 1970s. Although the publisher has called <i>Emotionally Weird</i> a comic novel, it is essentially unclassifiable, both further-reaching and less "meaningful" than it first appears. Kate Atkinson's book begins with chapter 1 of a bad murder mystery being written by Effie Andrews for a creative-writing course at the University of Dundee in 1972. But the action soon shifts to a wintry island in the Hebrides, where Effie is trying to elicit the story of her parentage from her single mother, Nora, while spinning a humorous first-person narrative of her college life. Only near the end of the book does she finally wrench the story from her mother: Effie's bizarre origins; the identity of her father; and the whole unlikely tale of her mother's family.<p> Like a Borgesian labyrinth, with other stories thrown in, including a laughably convenient introduction of magic realism, it is impossible to know what to take seriously--or "jocoseriously," to paraphrase another of Atkinson's influences: the Joyce of <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. In her third novel, much of Atkinson's humor is incidental, even parenthetical. (We are told in passing, for example, that Effie's dissertation is called "Henry James: Man or Maze?") She is at her best when introducing her eccentric characters, such as the elderly Professor Cousins, who is sometimes lucid, sometimes not. "As with anyone in the department," Effie explains, "it wasn't always easy to distinguish between the two states. The university's strict laws of tenure dictated that he had to be dead at least three months before he could be removed from behind his desk." Professor Cousins, like the author, enjoys word games along the order of those in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, and Atkinson's use of Scottish idiom comes to function as a sort of word game. She also brings in a few killjoys (a militant feminist, a militant Christian, a literary theorist) to complicate an already loopy narrative and to spike the punch. </p><blockquote> Janice smelt of piety and coal tar soap. She had recently become a Christian, a neophyte of a student Christian fellowship whose members roamed the corridors of Airlie, Belmont and Chalmers Halls looking for likely converts (the afraid, the alone, the abandoned) and those who needed to use the Bible to fill in the spaces where their personalities should have been. </blockquote> As <i>Emotionally Weird</i> develops, Atkinson relies more and more on the postmodern gag of characters commenting on the unfolding action. There is no telling how she finally draws these disparate threads onto a single spool, but in the end, even the slightest subplots are neatly tied up and the most transient characters accounted for. <i>--Regina Marler</i>The latest magical mystery tour de force from one of Britain?s most original novelists ? winner of the Whitbread First Novel Award for <i>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</i>. <br> <br>On a peat and heather island off the West Coast of Scotland, Effie and her mother, Nora, take refuge in the large mouldering house of their ancestors and tell each other stories.

This is not a biography. But perhaps it will encourage a future Knight biographer. Consider this a collection of essays as speculative, motley, and adrift as Knight himself. His various personas grace the book covers that are at any given moment resting beside my bed or on my desk. The bespectacled Knight in a prison cell on the back of 1968's Poems from Prison; the nappy bohemian Knight on the cover of 1973's Belly Song and Other Poems; the Mississippi Knight in cap and overalls on the cover 1980's Born of a Woman: New and Selected Poems; and the sober intellectual Knight on the cover of 1986's The Essential Etheridge Knight. Because he has been on my mind for virtually all my writing life, he has appeared from time to time among my poems: influencing perspective (as in "Poet Dying at the Window," from my first book), influencing voice (as in "The Blue Etheridge" from my third book), influencing form (as in "Portrait of Etheridge Knight in the Style of a Crime Report," from my fifth book). Each time I've returned to my work on Knight between publications of my own poetry books, only the impossibility of a biography has remained consistent. He remains both a muse and mystery.</p> <p><strong>When Were the Critical Decisions That Defined the Trajectory of This Life Made?</strong> <br>At some point in my years wandering/wondering in and between the lines of "The Idea of Ancestry," I began to think of myself as a real-life Charles Kinbote, the deranged scholar in Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962). Except where Kinbote is literally a mad professor unraveling a 999-line poem by his neighbor-poet, the murdered John Shade, I'm me: a poet, a brother, a southerner unraveling "The Idea of Ancestry," a poem by Etheridge Knight. The distinction between a scholar on the trail of a poet and a poet on the trail of a poet is an important one. The scholar looks upon his subject as if through a window. The scholar aims to frame the poet's work according to things like genre, talent, culture, history. A clear pane of logic, interpretation, and appreciation separates him from his subject. Conversely, a poet looking upon the poetry of another poet sees something of himself reflected in the pane. Process, imitation, and competition are reflected in the work. A poet looks upon the work of another poet not only through a window but also through a mirror. (Please forgive my generalizations.) What's odd about Charles Kinbote is (1) he believes the window is a mirror&#x2014;he sees only himself when he looks into it; and (2) he means to lift the window and climb, as a Peeping Tom (or Goldilocks) would, into the lines of his subject. He sees himself everywhere in the poem. Any interpretation of the poem is hogtied to the interpreter. The great, distorting power of Kinbote's imagination gives Nabokov's novel its tension and trajectory. Lampooning the practice of "close reading," Pale Fire shows how <br>"expertise" slides down a slippery slope into delusion. Delusion, depending on how you look at it, is a form of the imagination. Can imagination be a form of critical study? For more than a decade I have been imagining my way into the slants and shades of Etheridge Knight.</p> <p><strong>What Was the Contribution of Neighbors?</strong> <br>In 2005, I interviewed Knight's sister, Eunice Knight-Bowens, during my visit to Indianapolis to read in her 14th Annual Etheridge Knight Festival. The reading took place in a suburban mall in Indianapolis. Eunice had inaugurated the festival in 1992, a year after her brother's death from cancer. The roster included local poets who knew Knight, local high school students who might be the next Etheridge Knight, and poets like me who were drawn by Knight's ghost: Sonia Sanchez, his ex-wife, Amiri Baraka, his peer, groups of brother poets like John Murillo and Reginald Dwayne Betts. After a twenty-year run the festival ended in 2012, a year before Eunice passed away. What was the contribution of neighbors? The festival was made of, by, and for the neighbors of Indianapolis. Etheridge's Indianapolis, Eunice's Indianapolis. When Eunice looked into the window of her brother's poetry she saw her own stories reflected. Did she know from the get-go that her brother was a great, rare kind of poet? I can't say. I know she was happy that I came asking for stories. She put me up in a hotel Knight used to frequent. She said all the black writers met there to talk art and literature, but I was imagining all the booze, tobacco, and jive. The hotel room smelled of the cabbage she brought me and the cigarettes we smoked. I pushed the button on a small tape recorder. "I want people just to tell their stories about Knight, and everything is to come out of those stories," I told Eunice. She didn't miss a beat: "A lot of his poems, like 'The Idea of Ancestry,' were written while he was in prison, in 'the belly of the beast' as he called it," she said almost automatically. I now know she'd told the story behind the poem many times. So had her brother. "He memorized it, he said, to save his sanity. The aunts were true, the cousins. It's just a true poem." Some of what she said contradicted what I'd read about Knight's incarceration, some of what she said complicated what I'd read about his life. Knight may well be chief contributor to the lopsided details surrounding his life before imprisonment. Around whatever was his essential, inexplicable self were several identities: southerner, black, son, male, convict, poet. Around those identities were also several biographical holes, gaps and mysteries. He was the third of five children and third son of Etheridge Sr. and Belzora Cozart-Knight. I did not ask Eunice why he, and not one of his older brothers, Charles and Floydell, was named after his father. Regrettably, I did not interview any of his other living siblings. His mother and father were dead by then, his brother Charles and sister Lois were dead by then. I sat in one chair and Eunice sat in the other.She wore a blue headscarf and a skin the shade of her brother's skin. She and her brother, she said, came from a long line of storytellers. "My mother said that when they were little, before they went out to do their chores and before they went to school every morning, her oldest brother, my uncle Cid, played the organ and they had to sing. And so my mother could sing "do re mi" without music, and so every morning before they went out to do their chores and before they went to school, they had to sing music as an art." A sharp biographer will definitely need to find all of Knight's surviving relatives, his lovers and ex-lovers, his students, his son, Isaac BuShie Blackburn-Knight. I interviewed Mary Karr, who was one of Knight's students. I've interviewed his editor, Ed Ochester. I've interviewed and gossiped with or made plans to interview and gossip with maybe half a dozen other friends of Knight over the years. I've come nowhere close to gathering enough "facts" for a biography. I have not examined Knight's prison or war records; I have not interviewed inmates or staff at the jails and prisons; I have not interviewed the students of the Free People's Workshop. What was the contribution of neighbors? I have not interviewed his teammates on the army football team in Korea, the soldiers within earshot of his jive and tirades, the nurses who nursed him in rehab, the junkies or pushers who knew him. I have not interviewed Knight's lovers: Sonia Sanchez, Mary McAnally, Evelyn Brown, Elizabeth McKim, Charlene Blackburn. Knight's future biographer will have a lengthy chapter on romance. If we are lucky, someday some future biographer will land in Indianapolis and rent a small car and buy a map on his way to the Indiana State Prison or the factory where Knight worked as a punch-press operator during the five months of his parole or to 555 Massachusetts Avenue where Knight died in 1991 of lung cancer. If the future biographer's book is made into a movie, one hopes tropes of the blues and bluesman don't simplify Knight's life. It's an unreasonable hope, maybe. A life has to be simplified if it is to have shape, arc, trajectory: a biography needs a plot. Knight's story doesn't require much, I suppose. A couple of visits to Corinth, Mississippi, where he was born. To Paducah, Kentucky. I once thought a life was simply the accumulation of ideas, but now I think it may simply be the accumulation of details. Somewhere between detail and idea is the truth. Knight was often blowing smoke, as they say. And to write a biography one would need to gather all that smoke into something solid, something you could hold and turn over in your hands. "The Idea of Ancestry" almost suggests the idea of a biography is better than an actual biography.</p> <p><strong>What Role Was Played by More Distant Influences?</strong> <br>Influence is never distant. Or influence is always distant. This text is about influence. Biographies mean to spell out influence&#x2014;an impossible task. I felt I had two choices: a rigorously researched biography or a rigorously imagined biography. I imagine the black poet Etheridge Knight was influenced by the black Langston Hughes, for example. But, hell, I can imagine Hughes was a distant influence on every black poet for the last fifty or so years. In the late eighties right about the time I was a sophomore writing a research paper on Hughes, scholar Arnold Rampersad was publishing his encyclopedic, two-volume, nearly 1,000-page long biography on Hughes. Despite reams of source material, treks across the United States, Russia, France, and Italy, and pages of clear-eyed scholarship, Rampersad's The Life of Langston Hughes, Vol. I, 1902&#x2013;1941: I, Too, Sing America and The Life of Langston Hughes, Vol. II, 1941&#x2013;1967: I Dream a World are altogether dull. Rampersad casts Hughes as a classy, very normal, Duke Ellington of poetry: no demons, no skeletons, no hang-ups. My Hughes research paper had about as much insight as an encyclopedia entry. I wrote it, made, I think an A, and moved on to your typical high school fantasies of sexual and athletic conquests. Nothing I read or wrote made me think I, the bastard, undereducated son of the South could be a poet. A black poet was respectable, prolific, light-skinned. Years later, after I'd discovered Knight and the boundless galaxy of poetry, I learned there was much unsaid about Hughes. As Darryl Pinckney wrote in his 1989 New York Review of Books piece, Rampersad said too little "about Hughes's small hours and who, if anyone, was with him when he closed his door against the world." By the time I learned there was more than meets the eye to Hughes, I was already chasing Knight&#x2014;my mirror poet. I was certainly more Kinbote than Rampersad in my pursuit. I sidestepped research for guesswork; I was reading between the lines of photographs, interviews, letters, maps, scraps of details. Online I found the Callaloo special 1996 issue section featuring Knight's poems, letters, and an interview editor Charles Rowell conducted with Knight in Indianapolis between mid-1975 and late 1978. Jean Anaporte-Easton's essay, "Etheridge Knight: Poet and Prisoner&#x2014;an Introduction" provides thorough and thoughtful preamble. I heard she was working on a book, but that book has not yet materialized. The most comprehensive Knight study to date is Michael S. Collins's Understanding Etheridge Knight, published by the University of South Carolina Press in 2012. One of Knight's friends and former students, Collins offers a straightforward examination of Knight's life and poems. Who can define "distant influence"? </p> <p><strong>What Was the Role of Chance?<br></strong>The NUCLEOLUS is an essential, inexplicable, unadulterated self: the lover personality, the trickster personality, the intuitive personality, the multiple true names in a cell. The NUCLEUS is a sphere of identity (southerner, black, son, male, convict, poet) around the nucleolus. Identity drifts over the mind and body in a cell. LOVES resemble lightning rods, asymmetrical tracks, slanted crosses, bone-tired bones, prostrate limbs. As in the old footpath of a first love; the barely discernible trail of a crush. It is easier to love without speaking. Orpheus dragged long silences around with him. When I traveled to the smallest part of my body, I found CYTOPLASMIC SPACE. I am often a STRANGER to myself. It is in the restless wrestling to make a song out of despair that the HOPE begins to wheel and vibrate. FAMILY is a vast system of interconnected members, enfolded and convoluted sacks of nurture and/or trouble located in the selves' cytoplasm. Some family smoothly transports nostalgia, hope, esteem, love, and other positive materials through the cell. Some family is a hive, a rough patch, an outbreak that gives the appearance of several chips on a shrugging shoulder. A flattened, layered, sac-like stack of FEARS hovers near the heart of things. FUCKUPS move fear to other regions. Regarding love and addiction: it's not that the highs last, it's that one wants them to end so nostalgia can root itself in the future. Memory is more enduring than event. The influence of TEACHERS, the influence of FRIENDS who become teachers, as in relationships that convert the energy found in ignorance to the energy found in acquaintance, benevolence, fellowship. I'm still mulling the dimensions of a "cell." Biology is chance. Biography is chance. <strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>At What Point Was the Final Fate Initially Specified?<br></strong>Fate is still waiting to be specified.</p> <p><strong>When Was [Fate] Ultimately Sealed?</strong> <br>Fate is still waiting to be sealed. I'm thinking of meanings in a word like "cell." The cells adrift in a self adrift in a cell; the self between the cells that make us and the cells we make; the space around the nucleus of sensibility; the membrane around "The Idea of Ancestry." Taped to the wall of Knight's cell were the pictures of serenity, kinship, fellowship. I imagine the black faces of friends and teachers taped to the wall of his cell: a black face beneath a black hand raised like a visor over a squint; I'm imagining a black face adrift above a housedress, black faces gathered beneath an astronomical sky, black faces around a card table, a black face framed by a barn door. A lucky future biographer will need to speak to whoever is still alive among those 47 black faces, and if lucky, retrieve each of the 47 pictures taped to the wall of the cell.</p>|<p><strong>Line 33: I had almost caught up with me.</strong> <br>The giant many fans know as "Mega Tall Paul" was approximately half a century old the first time his father kissed him. Giants are difficult to kiss unless one is also a giant. As you know, Tall Paul towered in a realm of his own. The current Guinness World Records lists him as a clean eleven feet tall. He is in fact eleven foot, two and seven-eighths inches. After Tall Paul told a cashier, who'd asked his height, he was eleven feet, two and seven-eighths inches, she said with a frown, "Why you gotta add the seven-eighths, ain't eleven foot two already tall enough?" Tall Paul wanted to kiss her because no one else in all his years had ever told him it was a vain thing to say. He was well-known for his large self-regard, but told the cashier he was only trying to sound exact. He wanted to kiss her for her illuminated critique, and if he had, it would have required severe bending. Mostly Tall Paul hugged people to his waist; he did not bend. Most of the fans who lined up to greet him after his shows were children. Mostly all he did was stand around. He poke...</p></p><h2>The Real Christmas Book: Bb Edition</h2><p>(Fake Book).

When I said hello, it sounded slurred, as if I&#x2019;d been drinking for the last&#x2014;I worked it out&#x2014;three and a half hours instead of having some much-needed shut-eye. Three and a half hours. That made six hours of sleep in the last forty-eight. I squeezed my eyes closed and wished I hadn&#x2019;t added it up. Somehow, knowing the numbers made me feel worse.</p><p>&#x2018;Did I wake you, Kerrigan?&#x2019; I would have recognised the Manchester twang anywhere.</p><p>&#x2018;You know you did. What do you want?&#x2019;</p><p>I asked, but I already knew. There were only two reasons why Rob Langton would be ringing me at that hour of the morning sounding excited. One: there was another body. Two: they&#x2019;d caught the killer. Either way, I wasn&#x2019;t going back to sleep any time soon.</p><p>&#x2018;Got him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No way.&#x2019; I sat up in bed and put the light on, ignoring a groan from beside me and squinting as I tried to concentrate. &#x2018;Where? How?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We had a bit of help. Nice young lady out on the beers with a bladed article didn&#x2019;t take kindly to being next on the Burning Man&#x2019;s list.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s not dead.&#x2019; My heart was pounding. If he was dead, that was it. No answers. No trial.</p><p>No justice.</p><p>&#x2018;Nah, he&#x2019;s clinging on. He&#x2019;s in hospital. In surgery, at the minute. Two stab wounds to the abdomen; she lacerated his bowel.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ouch.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, couldn&#x2019;t happen to a nicer person.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Anyone we know?&#x2019; I rubbed my eyes with the heel of my hand and tried not to yawn.</p><p>&#x2018;Not known at all. Never been arrested before, and he hadn&#x2019;t come up in this enquiry.&#x2019;</p><p>I sighed. That wasn&#x2019;t great news. We hadn&#x2019;t even been close to catching him, then. We&#x2019;d just been lucky. Though the girl had been luckier still. I wasn&#x2019;t a fan of people wandering around carrying knives, but I&#x2019;d seen enough dead women in the past few weeks to think it wasn&#x2019;t such a bad idea.</p><p>&#x2018;His name&#x2019;s Vic Blackstaff. He had all his documents on him&#x2014;driver&#x2019;s licence, work ID. He&#x2019;s in his mid-fifties, does shift work for a call centre in Epsom. Lives in Peckham. Drives through south-west London to get home in the small hours of the morning. Plenty of opportunity.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Older than we&#x2019;d thought,&#x2019; I commented. &#x2018;Shift work fits, though. Where did it happen?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Richmond.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s quite a long way out of the usual area. Up to now he&#x2019;s stuck to Kennington, Stockwell&#x2014;nowhere as far out as Richmond.&#x2019; I was frowning.</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, but his usual area is flooded with uniforms. Makes sense that he would be hunting elsewhere, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; Rob sounded confident and I gave a mental shrug; who was I to second-guess a serial killer?</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re going through his car at the moment,&#x2019; Rob went on. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re waiting at the hospital.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s we?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Me and the boss. And DI Judd, unfortunately. We&#x2019;ll be interviewing the young lady as soon as the doctors tell us we can talk to her. She&#x2019;s still being checked out.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How is she? Is she&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want to fill in the rest of the sentence. Is she going to make it? Is she badly beaten? Is she burned? How far had he got?</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s fine. Shaken up. Nothing wrong with her but we haven&#x2019;t been allowed in to see her yet. She says she&#x2019;s not ready.&#x2019; Rob sounded impatient, which nettled me. Why shouldn&#x2019;t she take her time before speaking to the police? She&#x2019;d had a shock. What she needed was a sympathetic ear. And I was the ideal person to provide it. Energy flooded through my limbs, adrenalin pushing fatigue into a corner, to be ignored until I had time to give in to it again. Three hours&#x2019; sleep was plenty. I was already out of bed, making for the door, stumbling on rubbery legs that ached as if I&#x2019;d run a marathon the day before.</p><p>&#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;ll be there soon. Maybe they&#x2019;ll let me talk to her.&#x2019; The perks of being the only woman in Superintendent Godley&#x2019;s inner circle were not legion, but now and then it came in handy.</p><p>&#x2018;Why doesn&#x2019;t that surprise me? Nought to sixty in ten minutes, that&#x2019;s you.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why you phoned me, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; I was in the bathroom now, and debated whether I could risk peeing while on the phone. He&#x2019;d hear. I&#x2019;d have to wait.</p><p>&#x2018;I knew you&#x2019;d want to be here.&#x2019; That was only half the story; it suited them all for me to be there. I could hear Rob grinning; he was a smug git sometimes, but I could forgive him, because when all was said and done, I did want to be there, and without a call from him, I wouldn&#x2019;t have known a thing about it until I&#x2019;d seen it on the news.</p><p>&#x2018;Which hospital?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Kingston.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be there in half an hour,&#x2019; I said before I&#x2019;d thought about it properly. It was a long way from Primrose Hill to Kingston and I desperately needed a shower. My hair was sticking to my head. There was no way I was leaving with dirty hair. Not again. &#x2018;Make that forty minutes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re in the ICU. Phones off, so ring the hospital if you need us.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Will do.&#x2019;</p><p>I flicked the water on before going to the loo, but even so, it wasn&#x2019;t even close to warm enough when I forced myself to step into the slate-lined shower area, wincing as the spray hit my goose-pimpled skin. The showerhead was the size of a dinner plate and pumped out rain-forest levels of water; it was just a shame that it never got hot enough for me. Style over substance, as usual. But it wasn&#x2019;t my flat so I couldn&#x2019;t really complain. I was sharing it, officially, but I felt more like a guest. And not necessarily a welcome one, at times.</p><p>I had balled my hands together under my chin, hugging body heat to myself, and it was an effort to unknot my fingers and reach for the shampoo once the water started to approach tepidity. Haste made me fumble the shampoo cap and I swore as I heard it skitter around the sloping tiles that led to the drain. I left it there, hearing my mother&#x2019;s voice in my head, <i>sure, it can&#x2019;t fall any further</i>...Two minutes later, I stepped on it and had to muffle a yelp in the crook of my elbow as a sharp edge dug into the arch of my foot. Swearing was a help. I swore. A lot.</p><p>I scrubbed at my scalp until the muscles in my forearms complained and rinsed my hair for as long as I could allow myself to, eyes closed against the lather that slid down my face. Bliss to be clean again, joy to know that the case was coming to an end. I wanted to stay in there for ever with my eyes closed; I wanted to sleep&#x2014;how I wanted to sleep. But I couldn&#x2019;t. I had to get going. And by the time I got out of the shower, I was what passed for awake these days.</p><p>Back in the bedroom, I tried to be quiet, but I couldn&#x2019;t help rattling the hangers in the wardrobe when I was taking out a suit. I heard stirring behind me in the bed and bit my lip.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s up?&#x2019;</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t have spoken to Ian if he hadn&#x2019;t spoken to me; that was the rule I observed about getting up and leaving in the middle of the night. Not that I was sure he&#x2019;d ever noticed there was a rule.</p><p>&#x2018;Going to meet a murderer.&#x2019;</p><p>That earned me an opened eye. &#x2018;You got him. Well done.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It wasn&#x2019;t exactly all my own work, but thanks.&#x2019;</p><p>He rolled over onto his back and threw an arm over his face, shielding his eyes from the light. He was in his natural position now, hogging the middle of the bed. I suppressed the impulse to push him back onto his own side and hauled the sheet up instead, tucking him in. <i>Look, I care about you. See how thoughtful I am.</i></p><p>&#x2018;Mmm,&#x2019; was the response. He was on his way back to sleep. I slipped the dry-cleaner&#x2019;s bag off my suit and balled it up, squashing it into the bin. I should have taken it off sooner. The suit smelled of chemicals and I wrinkled my nose, reluctant to put it on. The forecast was for a cold day, and rain. I thought longingly of jeans tucked into boots, of chunky jumpers and long knitted scarves. God, dressing like a grown-up was a pain.</p><p>I sat on the edge of the bed to deal with my tights, coaxing them over damp skin, wary of ripping them. My hair dripped onto my shoulders, cold water running down my back. I hadn&#x2019;t got time for this. I hadn&#x2019;t got time for immaculate. Slowly, infinitely slowly, I worked the material up over my thighs and stood to haul the tights the rest of the way. It was not the most elegant moment of getting dressed, and I wasn&#x2019;t pleased to turn and find Ian staring at me, an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>&#x2018;So is this it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What do you mean?&#x2019; I slipped on a shirt, then stepped into my skirt, zipping it up quickly and smoothing it over my hips. That was better. More dignified. The waistband was loose, I noticed, the skirt hanging from my hips rather than my waist. It took the hem from on the knee to over it, from flattering to frump. I needed to eat more. I needed to rest.</p><p>&#x2018;I mean is this the end of it? Are you going to be around more?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Probably. Not for a little while&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve got to sort out the paperwork and get the case ready for the CPS. But after that, yeah.&#x2019;</p><p><i>If there isn&#x2019;t another serial killer waiting to take over from where the Burning Man left off. If nothing else goes wrong between now and Christmas. If all the criminals in London take the rest of the year off.</i></p><p>I was looking for shoes, my medium-heeled courts that didn&#x2019;t so much as nod to fashion but hey, I could wear them from now until midnight without a twinge of complaint from my feet. I could even run in them if I had to. One was in the corner of the room, where I&#x2019;d kicked it off. The other I eventually found under the bed, and had to sprawl inelegantly to retrieve it.</p><p>&#x2018;I hate the way they whistle and you come running.&#x2019; He sounded wide awake now, and cross. My heart sank.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s my job.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, it&#x2019;s your <i>job</i>. Sorry. I didn&#x2019;t realise.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do this now,&#x2019; I said, stabbing my feet into my shoes and grabbing my towel. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got to go. It&#x2019;s important and you know it.&#x2019;</p><p>He&#x2019;d sat up, leaning on one elbow, blue eyes hostile under thick eyebrows, his brown hair uncharacteristically untidy. &#x2018;What I know is that I haven&#x2019;t seen you for weeks. What I know is that I&#x2019;ll be ringing up Camilla to say you can&#x2019;t come to supper after all, and is that OK, and I&#x2019;m really sorry if it&#x2019;s mucked up her seating arrangement. What I know is that your job always seems to come first.&#x2019;</p><p>I let him rant, towelling most of the water out of my hair and then dragging a comb through it, trying to get it into some sort of order. No time to dry it; it would dry on the way to the hospital. A few wisps, a lighter brown than the rest, were already curling around my face.</p><p>&#x2018;Camilla works in an art gallery. She has nothing to do all day but rearrange the seating plan for her little dinner parties. It&#x2019;ll be a challenge for her.&#x2019;</p><p>He flopped back down and stared at the ceiling. &#x2018;You always do that.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Put down my friends because their jobs aren&#x2019;t as important or as worthwhile as yours.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;For God&#x2019;s sake...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not everyone wants to save the world, Maeve.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, it&#x2019;s just as important to make it look nice,&#x2019; I snapped, and regretted it as soon as I&#x2019;d said it. Camilla was sweet, sincere, a wide-eyed innocent that brought out the protective instinct in everyone who knew her, including me. Usually. The sharpness in my voice had been partly exhaustion and partly guilt; I <i>had</i> been thinking of skipping the dinner party she was throwing. It wasn&#x2019;t that I didn&#x2019;t like Ian&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;it was just that I couldn&#x2019;t stand the questions. <i>Any interesting cases lately? Why haven&#x2019;t you caught the Burning Man yet? What&#x2019;s the most hideous thing you&#x2019;ve ever seen on duty? Do you wish they still had capital punishment? Can you sort out this speeding ticket for me?</i> It was tedious and predictable and I found it acutely embarrassing to represent the Metropolitan Police to Ian&#x2019;s friends. I was just one person. And traffic tickets were definitely outside my purview.</p><p>&#x2018;Ian...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Aren&#x2019;t you in a hurry?&#x2019;</p><p>I checked my watch. &#x2018;Yes. Let&#x2019;s talk about this later, OK?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t wait.&#x2019;</p><p>I wanted to point out that I hadn&#x2019;t brought it up in the first place. Instead, I leaned across the bed and planted a kiss on the bit of Ian&#x2019;s chin I could reach easily. There was no response. With a sigh, I headed to the kitchen to pick up a banana, then grabbed my bag and my coat and ran down the stairs. I closed the front door with the key in the lock so I didn&#x2019;t wake the neighbours, though if they&#x2019;d slept through my shower and relationship issues, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t notice the door banging. If they were at home, and not on a pre-Christmas shopping trip to New York or a winter break in the Bahamas.</p><p>I stopped for a second on the doorstep, head down, my mind whirling.</p><p>&#x2018;What am I doing? What the hell am I doing?&#x2019;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to say it out loud, and I wasn&#x2019;t talking about work. I could handle work. My boyfriend was another matter. We&#x2019;d been together for eight months, lived together for six, and from the moment I&#x2019;d moved into Ian&#x2019;s place, the fighting had started. I&#x2019;d fallen for a big smile, broad shoulders and a job that had nothing to do with crime. He&#x2019;d told me he liked the dynamic, busy detective with long legs and no ulterior motives. I wasn&#x2019;t looking for a husband who could be the father to my children&#x2014;yet. My eyes didn&#x2019;t light up with pound signs when I heard he was in banking. It was all so easy. We saw one another when we could, snatched hours in bed at his place or mine, managed dinner together every so often and when my lease came up for renewal, Ian had taken a chance, the sort of gamble that had made him rich, and invited me to move in with him in his ludicrously over-designed, expensive flat in Primrose Hill. It hadn&#x2019;t been a good idea. It had been a disaster. And I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to get out of it. After two months, we hadn&#x2019;t known one another, except in the biblical sense. We hadn&#x2019;t worked out what we had in common, or how we might spend long winter afternoons when the weather made going out an unappealing prospect. As it turned out, we stayed in bed or we fought. There was no middle ground. I started to stay longer at work, left earlier in the morning, popped into the nick over the weekend even if I wasn&#x2019;t on duty. The only silver lining was the overtime pay.</p><p>The night air was harsh and I shivered as I hurried down the road, my hair cold against my neck. I was glad of the coat Ian had bought me, full-length and caramel-coloured in fine wool that was really too nice for ...</p></p><h2>New York Projectile Points: A Typology and Nomenclature</h2><p>Bulletin 384 of the New York State Museum.

Patrick Flanagan wrote this follow-up volume, about which he comments: "Since I wrote my two previous publications on pyramid energy in 1971 (The Pyramid and its Relationship to Biocosmic Energy and Pyramid Power) I have had over four years of additional experience with these unusual energy fields. The results of this research have never been made public. I will reveal for the first time, the results of these discoveries, and details of the construction of the Pyramid Energy Plates. Most of these discoveries were made in a six month period following my trip to the Great Pyramid of Giza in September, 1974. On that trip, I culminated years of research into unusual energies by spending the night in the King&#x2019;s Chamber of the Pyramid of Cheops. Full details of that exciting night will be given in a forthcoming book. I can reveal that I made contact with a powerful force that has changed my life in drastic ways. Some of my latest findings may tend to contradict a few of my earlier statements on the subject. This is the result of an increased understanding of the mechanics of these energy fields. I have succeeded, since returning from Egypt, in harnessing these elusive energies in practical ways. Energy fields have been produced and transmitted over long distances and detected at a remote receiver. In other words, a new communications technology has been discovered. Pyramid energy has been taken from the realm of the mystical toy, and projected into the infancy of a new technology that could literally change the living condition of man on this planet. I call these new discoveries Tensor Field Devices. A few of these developments are: Tensor Field Voice Communicator; Tensor Field Propulsion; Tensor Field Electro-Catalytic Seed Treatment, which raises the vigor level of seeds from 60% to 80%; and Tensor Field Water Treatment Systems. Additional devices will be described toward the end of this The shape of the pyramid has been experimentally found to have unusual effects on organic media. It was found to mummify meat and other foods, preserving them without decay; improve the flavor of foods and cigarettes; age wine and other drinks; increase the life-span of small animals; improve the growth rate of plants; improve or enhance the meditative state; and keep razor blades from becoming dull! There has been some controversy on this subject as test results are not always consistent. We have found that many variables affect the pyramid&#x2019;s performance: alignment to the earth&#x2019;s magnetic fields; electric fields; other objects in the vicinity; and the experimenter&#x2019;s mind can sometimes influence the results. Sorting out and isolating these variables has been the subject of my research over the years. As my own results were over 90% consistent, I had enough evidence to keep my interest alive. Even N.A.S.A. has realized the importance of the pyramid shape as evidenced by a new patent application showing the use of pyramids and cones as sources of electric power." Of 'Beyond Pyramid Power,' the International Business Connection, Inc. writes, "Excellent insight to magnetic form resonance, tensor fields scalar energies and topological electronics. Flanagan is a true genius and his discoveries continue to subtly shape our world. Fifty years from now, this book will be a classic because it describes lesser-known technologies that will hopefully be second nature to future generations. I am a researcher and have had tremendous results because of the impact of this book, and also other researches of Dr. Flanagan."</p><p>Patrick Flanagan's prodigy-like brilliance blossomed early in life when, at the age of 11, he won a science fair with a self-created guided missile detection system that quickly brought the Pentagon calling and was eventually sold to the U.S. Military--albeit upon threat of confiscation. While still in his teens, he gained his pilot's license and was employed by a Think Tank at The Pentagon,and later as a consultant to the NSA, CIA, NASA, Tufts University, the Office of Naval Research, and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds for the Department of Unconventional Weapons and Warfare. Without exaggerating Patrick Flanagan may be regarded as one of the most important scientists of the last 45 years. He has made numerous discoveries and inventions within the fields of biochemistry, physics and nanotechnology. With over 300 patents he was named, in 1997, by the &#x201c;International Association for New Science&#x201d; as &#x201c;Scientist of the Year&#x201d;.

Reverence for Jesus among early Christians, notes Hurtado, included both grand claims about Jesus' significance and a pattern of devotional practices that effectively treated him as divine. This book argues that whatever one makes of such devotion to Jesus, the subject deserves serious historical consideration.<br><br> Mapping out the lively current debate about Jesus, Hurtado explains the evidence, issues, and positions at stake. He goes on to treat the opposition to -- and severe costs of -- worshiping Jesus, the history of incorporating such devotion into Jewish monotheism, and the role of religious experience in Christianity's development out of Judaism. The follow-up to Hurtado's award-winning<i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>&nbsp;(2003), this book provides compelling answers to queries about the development of the church's belief in the divinity of Jesus.</p><p>Larry W.

Alister McGrath shows convincingly that reason is only one of many possible points of contact between the non-Christian and the gospel. In today's world, nonrational concerns -- such as a sense that life lacks focus, an unconscious fear of death, a deep sense of longing for something unknown we don&#x2019;t have but know we need -- are much more effective points of contact for apologetics. In this book, Dr. McGrath (who is both a theologian and a scientist with a Ph.D. in microbiology) combines the clarity of a brilliant scientific mind with a deep commitment to Christ and to reaching non-Christians. Intellectuals Don't Need God is for anyone who has questions about the validity of Christianity as well as for students, pastors, and lay leaders. Anyone who works with students and young people especially needs to read this book. As McGrath says, "apologetics is not about winning arguments -- it is about bringing people to Christ."</p></p><p><p>Alister E.

One thinks of Boris Becker, the noted tennis player, who came close to taking his own life through being overwhelmed by this sense of hopelessness and emptiness. Even though he was enormously successful, something was missing. I had won Wimbledon twice before, once as the youngest player. I was rich. I had all the material possessions I needed: money, cars, women, everything.... I know that this is a cliche. It&#39;s the old song of the movie and pop stars who commit suicide. They have everything, and yet they are so unhappy.... I had no inner peace. I was a puppet on a string. Or one thinks of Jack Higgins, a highly successful thriller writer at the top of his profession, author of best-selling novels such as The Eagle Has Landed. He is reported to have been asked what he now knew that he would like to have known when he was a boy. His reply: &#39;That when you get to the top, there&#39;s nothing there.&#39; Becker and Higgins are excellent witnesses from the world of secular culture to the fact that most people are aware that something is missing from their lives, even if they are not able to put a name to it or may not be able to do anything about it. But the Christian gospel is able to interpret this sense of longing, this feeling of unfulfillment, as an awareness of the absence of God---and thus to prepare the way for its fulfillment. A. Apologetics Is Grounded in the Doctrines of Creation and Redemption Through the grace of God, the creation points to its Creator. Through the generosity of God, we have been left with a latent memory of him, capable of stirring us toward a fuller recollection of him. Although there is a fracture between the ideal and the empirical, between the realms of fallen and redeemed creation, the memory of that connection lives on, along with the intimation of its restoration through redemption. If there is some point of contact already in existence, then apologetics can make use of a God-given starting point in the very nature of the created order itself. The witness to God within his creation, the &#39;signals of transcendence&#39; (Peter Berger) in human life, can act as a trigger, stimulating people to ask questions about the meaning of life or the reality of God. Those points of contact are meant to be there---and they are meant to be used. A point of contact is a God-given foothold for divine self-revelation. It is a catalyst, not a substitute, for God&#39;s self-revelation. It is like the advance guard of an army, preparing the ground for the major force that follows it. It is like the prestrike of a bolt of lightning, in which a conductive path is established from the earth to the sky so that the massive energy of the lightning can discharge itself fully into the waiting earth. God gives himself in the act of revelation; there is, however, a sense in which he has prepared the ground for that giving: not to preempt it, nor to make it unnecessary, but simply to make it more effective when it finally happens. But we must be careful. Points of contact are not in themselves adequate to bring people into the kingdom of God. They are merely starting points. Nor are they adequate in themselves to bring people to a specifically Christian faith. They might well point toward the existence of a creative and benevolent supreme being. The connection with &#39;the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&#39; (1 Peter 1:3) remains to be made. The apologist must still show that the Christian gospel is consistent with these points of contact, that it is able to explain them, and more than that it is able to deliver all that they promise, turning hints into reality. Christian apologetics cannot go beyond the boundaries of the biblical insights concerning the revelation of God in his creation, but it must feel able to press on toward those full limits authorized by Scripture. It must do this cautiously, wary of the dangers that lie in the path of an uncritical appeal to creation. Among those dangers, the following may be noted as especially significant. a. There is a limit to what human reason can discern about God by an appeal to nature. Sin brings with it a propensity for distortion, by which God&#39;s revelation in creation is easily changed into an idol of our own making. The egocentricity of human sin, grounded in the fallen human will, expresses itself in the fatal wish of fallen humanity to create God in its own image and likeness, rather than to respond obediently to the self-revelation of God. This disobedience is without excuse (Rom. 1:18--2:16). Yet this flagrant abuse of God&#39;s revelation in nature does not discredit a cautious and responsible appeal to nature as pointing beyond itself to the one who created it and who will one day recreate it in glory---that is, God himself. There is thus a fracture within creation. Fallen human nature can only reflect on a fallen creation. The fallenness of both the beholder and that which is beheld thus introduces a twofold distortion. This is most emphatically not to say that no knowledge of God may be had. Rather, we must admit that this knowledge is imperfect, broken, confused, and darkened, like a cracked mirror or a misty window. Anything that reveals less than the complete picture potentially presents a distorted picture. A &#39;natural knowledge of God&#39; is thus a distorted knowledge of God. But as a starting point it has real potential and value. And responsible Christian apologetics makes no claim greater than this: That our perceptions of God from nature can be taken up and transfigured by the Christian revelation, in Christ and through Scripture. b. How can the infinite ever be disclosed through the finite? How can God, who is infinite, reveal himself through or in nature, which is finite? Early Christian writers were fond of comparing our ability to understand God with looking directly into the midday summer sun. The human mind can no more cope with God than the human eye can handle the intense glare and heat of the sun. So how can a finite and weak creature ever comprehend the Creator? The most thorough-going response to this question relates to the &#39;principle of analogy,&#39; an idea deeply grounded in Scripture and given sophisticated theological development in the writings of such individuals as Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin. The basic idea can be stated as follows. In creating the world, God leaves his trace upon it. Just as an artist might sign a painting to draw attention to the fact that it is his or her creation, so God has left the imprint of his nature upon the created order. This is no historical accident; it is the self-expression of God in his world. And just as the eye can cope with the brilliance of the sun by looking at it through a piece of dark glass, so God wills to make himself known in a manageable way in his creation.</p><h2>Mammals of Arizona Field Guide (Mammal Identification Guides)</h2><p>From mice to mountain lions, identifying mammals can be simple, informative and fun.

I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll understand when I say I was fearful. It was one of those times when I would have cherished having an angel with me in the room, assuring me everything would be okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the months that followed I felt the same fear when I prepared to have surgery on two occasions. An angel&#x2019;s hand holding mine as I was wheeled into the operating room would have been treasured comfort.<br>&nbsp;<br>But as far as I knew, I&#x2019;d never seen an angel. Never. Did that mean something was wrong with me? Why did only other people have that privilege? Wasn&#x2019;t I spiritual enough?<br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe you&#x2019;ve asked the same questions. And maybe you&#x2019;re dissatisfied with the answers you&#x2019;ve received. The widespread interest in angels has thrown a lot of information your way&#x2014;but also confusion and contradiction and flimsy speculation. Where can you go for solid, meaningful information? How can you gain a balanced and accurate perspective that&#x2019;s built on God&#x2019;s reality and eternal truth?<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s what this book is all about.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Welcome Wonders, or a Waste of Time?</i><br>Ever since the 1990s, angels are everywhere&#x2014;or rather we find them <i>talked about </i>everywhere, from major magazines and bestselling books and I popular TV shows to kitchen conversations and university seminars. Lots of people say they have actually seen or felt the presence of an angel. Never in history, I suppose, has so much attention been directed at these heavenly beings as in our day.<br>&nbsp;<br>So what&#x2019;s the significance of it all? Is the Lord delighted by this burst of curiosity and belief? And does he want you and me to join in the fun&#x2014;or at least to take a bit more notice of angels than past generations did? Should we be looking around on earth for these heavenly beings? Should we be confident of daily care and protection from angel guardians?<br>&nbsp;<br>Or is all this a waste of time? Maybe the angel craze that peaked in the 90s was at best just another trivial fad, and at worst a deceptive tactic of Satan&#x2019;s to divert people&#x2019;s spiritual attention away from real truth. Like young children at the Grand Canyon who can&#x2019;t see beyond the spoiled chipmunks darting along the rim seeking tourist handouts, if we start focusing on angels, we might miss the grand, sweeping view of God.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the other hand, could more attention on angels actually be God&#x2019;s desire and plan for his people at this moment in history? Is it perhaps a clue and signal that we&#x2019;re on the threshold of something bigger in God&#x2019;s timetable for the world? Is the present age about to end? In God&#x2019;s mercy and love for sinners, has he caused a belief in spiritual angels to be more respectable so people can better accept the spiritual message of the gospel&#x2014;before it&#x2019;s too late?<br>&nbsp;<br>Or as some highly respected Bible teachers say, is there no such thing as angelic activity in our world anymore, since the close of Bible times?<br>&nbsp;<br>The questions go on and on. (I wonder if the angels are asking them too.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Probably no major theological issue has received as much secular attention in modern times as the doctrine of angels has in our day. You would expect Christians to be delighted at this, and start rushing in to make the most of this fresh opportunity for spiritual dialogue with the non-Christian world. But a good many Christians don&#x2019;t know what (if anything) to think about angels.<br>&nbsp;<br>At least when the &#x201c;God is dead&#x201d; notion grabbed headlines a few decades ago, Christians were united in their response: No, they proclaimed, God is alive! But when headlines along the grocery checkout lane talk about widespread angel activity and belief in personal angels, the typical Christian reaction is: Well, maybe&#x2014;or maybe not.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Dangers</i><br>The angel craze seemed to trigger a major shift in thinking for our culture. What had once been mostly a myth to previouis generations became a fascinating reality in the popular mind. For example, more than a million people worldwide read the bimonthly Guideposts magazine <i>Angels on Earth, </i>in which each issue features a handfull of stories about people who believe they&#x2019;ve encountered angels.<br>&nbsp;<br>This all seems to fit into a greater openness to spirituality that&#x2019;s been building for years. Few people think anymore that all of life&#x2019;s important answers can be found in science and rational thought and reasonable logic. They know reality has another dimension&#x2014;a spiritual dimension beyond science and reason. And this &#x201c;other&#x201d; side of reality keeps growing bigger in popular thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>What does all this mean? Is it good or bad?<br>&nbsp;<br>The biggest danger may well be greater susceptibility to spirituality&#x2019;s dark side. Mankind&#x2019;s mental doorway may be open wider to thinking about religion and eternity, but it&#x2019;s probably also open wider to Satan&#x2019;s influence.<br>&nbsp;<br>Scripture warns us that &#x201c;Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light&#x201d; (2 Corinthians 11:14). Perhaps this strategy of deception wasn&#x2019;t so effective in the generations just before us. People weren&#x2019;t as open to believing in angels then, and if you talked about seeing one or wanting to, you might have been called flighty or foolish or weird.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now the situation has changed. It&#x2019;s acceptable and even fashionable to believe in angels, and millions around the world are looking for angelic activity as never before.<br>&nbsp;<br>But a stronger belief in angels is no guarantee of greater understanding of God&#x2019;s truth. The devil can ensnare us as much through &#x201c;angelism&#x201d; as he can through materialism or sexual lust or power-hunger. In fact he has scored some of his greatest triumphs in the disguise of angels. In the year 610 the oppressive religion of Islam was born when Muhammed received the contents of the Koran in a series of visions from someone he believed to be the angel Gabriel. Twelve centuries later, the deceptive cult of Mormonism<br>supposedly arose when an angelic being called Moroni got Joseph Smith connected with the Book of Mormon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Is Satan doing the same thing again? Or instead of launching a big new anti-Christian religion or cult, perhaps he and his demons are simply using angelic disguise&#x2014;a little here and a little there&#x2014;to flirt with people&#x2019;s fascinations and to create a curiosity and craving for angelic presence. By influencing the right people with the right connections to get the right books and magazine articles published and the right TV shows on the air, he can lure millions into a false sense of spiritual experience and security. The syrupy sweet,<br>spirit-tingling taste of a little angelism can ruin people&#x2019;s appetite for the good, solid food of God&#x2019;s Word and his gospel of grace and truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even secular publications recognized at least partly this aspect of angelmania. They noted the easy lure of preferring angels over God and describe how angels offer a form of spirituality devoid of Jesus and God. Because belief in God is no longer &#x201c;popular&#x201d; in America, it is possible to believe in anything. People are searching for spirituality&#x2013;but not if it involves God. <i>Time </i>magazine insightfully stated, &#x201c;angels are the handy compromise, all fluff and meringue, kind, nonjudgmental. They are available to everyone, like aspirin.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Life </i>magazine attached the label &#x201c;God Lite&#x201d; to the angelism movement. The magazine&#x2019;s reporter visited a conference of angel enthusiasts. Unlike the mighty heavenly beings described in the Bible, the reporter said the angels described to him at the conference were<br>&nbsp;<br>a more benign and bite-size species, cuddly as a lap dog, conscientious<br>as a school crossing guard. I heard angels likened to spiritual<br>kissing cousins, flower delivery messengers... and just a nice feeling<br>of warmth and love that washes all over you. Today&#x2019;s angels seem to<br>spend a lot less time praising God than serving us. While they are<br>still making super-hero, nick-of-time rescues, they are also showing<br>up in less dire emergencies to track down a set of lost keys or make<br>a chicken casserole more flavorful. Indeed, nearly all the angel<br>believers I met got around to mentioning their parking space angel<br>whom they call upon while cruising crowded city streets.<br>&nbsp;<br>If some of your neighbors or friends or family members become attracted to an empty and frivolous but potentially dangerous angelism, will you be able to steer them out by showing them God&#x2019;s truth about angels? It&#x2019;s my prayer that this book will help you do just that. There&#x2019;s nothing that deals with error like a good dose of truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile let&#x2019;s remember God is sovereign. He&#x2019;s shown in history that he uses even the mistakes and tragedies and follies of mankind to accomplish his higher will. Could it be that in our day he&#x2019;s using angelmania&#x2014;even though it&#x2019;s often excessive and eccentric&#x2014;to give his people a certain push? Does he want to sharpen our sensitivity toward spiritual realities? After all, it looks as if angels will be a big part of our eternal environment, which will be far more substantial than our short and shadowy presence on this earth. Being eternal themselves, angels have a greater claim to &#x201c;reality&#x201d; than our homes and jobs and hobbies. And unlike our homes and jobs and hobbies, the holy angels are always pointing us in the right direction: toward God.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just thinking about angels can give us a fresh reminder that there&#x2019;s another world besides this one that clings so closely all around us.

On the Lower East Side, two boys playing at a pier discover a floating human torso wrapped tightly in oilcloth. Blueberry pickers near Harlem stumble upon neatly severed limbs in an overgrown ditch. Clues to a horrifying crime are turning up all over New York, but the police are baffled: There are no witnesses, no motives, no suspects.<br>&nbsp;<br>The grisly finds that began on the afternoon of June 26, 1897, plunged detectives<br>headlong into the era's most baffling murder mystery. Seized upon by battling media moguls Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, the case became a publicity circus. Reenactments of the murder were staged in Times Square, armed reporters lurked in the streets of Hell's Kitchen in pursuit of suspects, and an unlikely trio--a hard-luck cop, a cub reporter, and an eccentric professor--all raced to solve the crime.<br>&nbsp;<br>What emerged was a sensational love triangle and an even more sensational trial: an unprecedented capital case hinging on circumstantial evidence around a victim whom the police couldn't identify with certainty, and who the defense claimed wasn't even dead. <i>The Murder of the Century </i>is a rollicking tale--a rich evocation of America during the Gilded Age and a colorful re-creation of the tabloid wars that have dominated media to this day.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>PAUL COLLINS</b> is the author of seven books, which have been translated into ten languages.

Adapting to his new environs will require a steep learning curve, but the world&#x2019;s greatest magician is nothing if not flexible. In fact, the question that his fellow inmates should be asking is not how this strange-talking newcomer will endure being locked up with society&#x2019;s worst offenders, but rather how they are going to survive the experience. <br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s because Constantine has a few more stops to make on his stateside tour, and, unlike his cellmates, his journey begins in the joint rather than ending there.

Outfitted with on-point pop culture references, these essays tackle a wide range of topics: giving feminism a tough-love talk on intersectionality, telling society's beauty standards to kick rocks, and calling foul on our culture's obsession with work. Robinson also gets personal, exploring money problems she's hidden from her parents, how dating is mainly a warmed-over bowl of hot mess, and, definitely most important, meeting Bono not once, but twice. She's struggled with being a woman with a political mind and a woman with an ever-changing jeans size.

And let&#x2019;s not forget the murder of Harambe, the gorilla, at the Cincinnati Zoo; Apple removing the headphone jack from their iPhones because this company is hell-bent on being the Nurse Ratched of our time; or the first black bachelorette, Rachel Lindsay, incorrectly choosing Bryan over Peter, thus denying the world some cocoa, gap-teefed babies. Oh! And remember a few years ago when a dude in the US legit had Ebola and went bowling and ate chicken wings with friends instead of quarantining himself because #WhiteNonsense? Say it with me: <i>Dumpster</i>. <i>Fire</i>. But far and away, the most telling sign that the world is in dire straits is the fact that in the past few years, the universe started killing off everyone who mattered in my childhood.<br><br> There was Carrie Fisher (White Jesus, why?), Prince (Black Jesus, why?), George Michael (Levi Jeans Jesus, I can&#x2019;t), and David Bowie (Alien Jesus aka the feathers from Bj�rk&#x2019;s swan dress at the 2001 Oscar ceremony, &lt;<i>squawk, blergh, blop&gt;</i>&#x2014;because y&#x2019;all know Bj�rk and anything in Bj�rk&#x2019;s universe only communicates through sound). Oof. I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I was overcome with emotion at seeing so many pop culture icons pass. Utterly devastated. Heartbroken and beside myself. So I mourned like we all did. <i>Appropriately</i>. Okay, I didn&#x2019;t, but I tried. Well, I tried the way I do when the heater in my apartment is too high and instead of getting up to adjust the thermostat, I say to no one, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too hot,&#x201d; and then unzip my onesie down to my hips so that I end up looking like a caterpillar taking a cigarette break mid-metamorph-morph aka metamorphosis. #IgnorantAbbrev #SorryForWastingYourTime. Anyhoo, I did not try very hard not to be utterly inappropriate mere days after Bowie&#x2019;s death.<br><br> When he passed, I fell down the usual internet rabbit hole many of us are wont to do when someone famous dies. I read think pieces, bought any albums I didn&#x2019;t already own, watched old performances on YouTube. After about forty-eight hours of this, I became an unofficial truther of Bowie&#x2019;s personal life, hoping that in my quest to unearth all the last unknown details about him, this busywork would distract me from the reality that we&#x2019;re all going to die. And since this mission was rooted in earnest and profound love for the dead, I felt like Doogie Howser at the end of <i>Doogie Howser, M.D.</i>, just writing smart bon mots about what I&#x2019;d learned. But I wasn&#x2019;t. My good intentions were quickly replaced by my just-below-the-surface hot-mess tendencies.<br> About three days after Bowie died and amid a particularly wide-eyed-and-awake-at-four-in-the-morning internet hunt, I typed this into Google:<br><br> Did David Bowie have a big penis?<br><br> I know, I know, <i>I know</i>! And it&#x2019;s not like I pulled up Googs&#x2019;s &#x201c;incognito window,&#x201d; which wouldn&#x2019;t have recorded this question in my browser&#x2019;s history. I typed this question in the broad-as-the-Alaskan-daylight-during-midnight-sun season aka Google&#x2019;s regular search window, where anyone could track what I&#x2019;d done. To which, Google basically responded � la Danny Glover from the <i>Lethal Weapon </i>franchise, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old for this shit,&#x201d; and then set about unsuccessfully trying to save me from my trifling ways. I started with &#x201c;Did David Bowie,&#x201d; and before I could continue, Google countered with this auto- complete:<br><br> Did David Bowie wrote &#x201c;My Way&#x201d;<br><br> What in the hell kind of poor-grammar-of-a-troubled-youth-from-<i>Dangerous-Minds </i>voodoo is this? Can&#x2019;t lie, I admire the tactic, but this search engine knew not who they were messing with. In my twenties, I once had a girls&#x2019; sleepover and made us watch <i>Showgirls</i>. Then we went to bed, and when we woke up, I convinced them to watch <i>Showgirls </i>again. Clearly, my ignorance is only matched by my determination. Googs sounding like the &#x201c;Cash Me Outside, How &#x2018;Bout Dat&#x201d; girl was cute, but no way was that stopping me.<br><br> So next Google tried to attract me with honey:<br><br> Did David Bowie Have Pets<br><br> Suggesting there might be pictures of pets at the end of this search is the visual equivalent of a coworker telling you there are cookies in the break room. I&#x2019;m intrigued, but I&#x2019;m a grown-ass woman and can literally get cookies any time I want. Plus, I have an &#x201c;in case of emergency&#x201d; photo album on my phone called &#x201c;Chocolate Puggle Puppies.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m good, Google.<br><br> Starting to feel defeated and tired, Googs began throwing haymakers, but it didn&#x2019;t have the strength, and as soon as I typed &#x201c;a,&#x201d; I was met with this:<br><br> Did David Bowie Have Any Siblings<br><br> Lmao.com/WhenSearchEnginesGiveUpAndStartSoundingLikeAOneNightStandStrugglingToMakeConversationOverBreakfast.<br><br> And then when I hit the space bar after the letter &#x201c;a&#x201d; and typed &#x201c;big,&#x201d; Google knew it couldn&#x2019;t save me from myself, probably did the sign of the cross, and mumbled under its breath, &#x201c;Maya Angelou, I know you didn&#x2019;t work this hard so Phoebe could do this bullshit, yet here we are.&#x201d; I typed &#x201c;penis.&#x201d; And pressed enter.<br><br> Yes. This. Is. Trash. And. I. Am. Not. Proud. But like I stated earlier, I&#x2019;m a truther, and somewhere along the way of reading copious amounts of articles and learning the basic deets&#x2014;why his eyes were two different colors (they weren&#x2019;t; they were both blue&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just that one had a permanently dilated pupil after he got in a fight with a good friend whose fingernail sliced into his eye), the name of his first band (the Konrads), and checking out his and Freddie Mercury&#x2019;s isolated vocals on &#x201c;Under Pressure&#x201d; (if you haven&#x2019;t, please listen ASAP)&#x2014;I stumbled across an old interview with one of his exes, who &#x201c;casually&#x201d; mentioned that Bowie was packing down below.<br><br> Three things:<br><br> 1. LOL for the rest of my life over his ex &#x201c;happening&#x201d; to provide a State of the Naysh about his peen. It is wack to kiss and tell about someone, especially if the person in question has moved on (Bowie married the love of his life, Iman), but more importantly, peen size never <i>casually </i>comes up in conversation. It&#x2019;s not like some dude is chilling at a house party, shooting the breeze about the latest home renovation he&#x2019;s working on, and goes, &#x201c;Speaking of wood, the other day, I chubbed twice and measured once and whaddya know? I have a big dick.&#x201d; Real talk, discussing peen size in the press is an IHOP (<b>I</b>ntentional <b>H</b>ijack <b>O</b>f convo vis-�-vis <b>P</b>een) triple stack. She knew this was going to get her attention, so she did it.<br><br> 2. I&#x2019;m not even a size queen! Just like a nation hosting a hundred-plus countries at the Summer Olympics, after the countries proved your athleticism, if you qualify as sauseege, I&#x2019;m giving you a thumbs-up, a team windbreaker, and a Target-sponsored sports bottle. I welcome all even if you have no chance of making the podium. <i>ANYWAY</i>. What I&#x2019;m getting at here is that I didn&#x2019;t truly care what the answer was going to be re: Bowie&#x2019;s peen.<br><br> 3. If a dude had Googled about Zsa Zsa Gabor&#x2019;s tatas after she passed away (RIP, boo-boo), I would have hollered to the heavens in the key of &#x201c;Hell to the naw, to the naw, naw, naw,&#x201d; which is one key below Mary J. Blige&#x2019;s &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my period, at Walgreens, and they&#x2019;re out of Toblerones, so I can&#x2019;t get my chocolate fix&#x201d; key. In short, I would have been livid and grossed out.<br> Yet there I was, trying to Lester Holt my way to the truth. Why? Because I am a trash person living in a trash world.<br><br> To be clear, I&#x2019;m not calling myself &#x201c;trash&#x201d; because I&#x2019;m fishing for a compliment. I&#x2019;m saying this because I love myself. And you know what they say: Only with the people and things you love can you be truly, and sometimes brutally, honest. As funny, smart, kind, thoughtful, pretty, warm, and talented as I can be, I am also a ludicrous trash fire like the kind you see on <i>Naked and Afraid </i>when people sign up to be in the wilderness when they&#x2019;re barely capable of troubleshooting Mozilla Firefox, let alone making an actual fire from scratch, so they end up with fire that&#x2019;s the length, width, and height of <i>just </i>the hair part of a troll doll. Real talk though, if my allergic-to-manual-labor-with-the-upper-body-strength-of-an-eight-year-old self could find a dude who could make a fire as big as an <i>entire </i>troll doll (if not bigger), I would say adios to &#x201c;spray and pray&#x201d; life and yes to &#x201c;leave it in and let our new lineage begin&#x201d; life. (Mom and Dad, I literally do not engage in spray and pray; this is just jokes.) MOVING ON! What I&#x2019;m getting at is that I can be a nightmare, but in case you don&#x2019;t believe me, here&#x2019;s a sampling of my trash from the past couple of months:<br><br> � I&#x2019;ve walked into several stores mere minutes before closing and took my sweet-ass time shopping.<br><br> � I ordered and ate a small Papa John&#x2019;s personal pan pizza because I didn&#x2019;t feel like washing a Granny Smith apple that was straight chilling in my crisper.<br><br> � I misspelled my own name.<br><br> � I attempted to cancel my own going-away party one hour before it was supposed to start because it was raining. Not like disaster-movie rain, but what Seattle would call &#x201c;Every day.&#x201d;<br><br> � Instead of telling my masseuse that I needed a moment, I eked out a fart in segments like it was a seven-course tasting menu at Spago. Oy. A fart is still a fart no matter how you try and dole it out over time to lessen its effects. I think the Dalai Lams said that.<br><br> � I rented <i>The Counselor </i>on iTunes even though it only has a 35 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes just so I could look at Michael Fassbender&#x2019;s hotness. The movie&#x2014;dis is where they fuq&#x2019;d up&#x2014;put his sex scene as the film&#x2019;s <i>opening </i>scene, so then I just watched that and turned the film off. Rude? Yes. A waste of my money? <i>Of course</i>. But also, everyone knows when you make a lame-ass movie, you put the sex scene like forty-three minutes in so the viewer will be too invested to peace out. So really, it was the filmmakers&#x2019; fault for putting the sex scene up top, giving me time to abort mish and still catch the monologue on <i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i>.<br><br> � I made my ringtone the &#x201c;Somebody!&#x201d; part from Smash Mouth&#x2019;s &#x201c;All Star.&#x201d;<br><br> � I skipped going to Equinox because I didn&#x2019;t feel like walking the flight and a half of stairs to get inside the gym. Like I don&#x2019;t want to have to work out <i>before </i>working out. That&#x2019;s too much working out.<br><br> � I snuck a burrito bowl from Chipotle into the movie theater and made it everyone&#x2019;s responsibility during <i>Creed </i>to be a lookout in an after-school special and make sure I didn&#x2019;t get busted by one of the ushers.<br><br> � When I was behind on my student loans and the American Student Assistance would call me, I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Now&#x2019;s not a good time to chat.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d ask when they could call back and I&#x2019;d pretend to be earnest and give them a time, knowing damn well I wasn&#x2019;t going to pick up my phone at 4:45 p.m.<br><br> � Even though <i>The Bachelor </i>and <i>The Bachelorette </i>burn my toast with their antifeminist ignorance, I watched <i>The Bachelorette </i>when they cast their first black bachelorette, Rachel Lindsay, and I thought, <i>Ooooooh, this must&#x2019;ve been what some white women went through when they chose race over gender and voted for Trump. </i>Literally. Not. The. Same. Thing.<br><br> � I had my sister-in-law, who lives in Cleveland, buy and mail me &#x201c;ros� all day&#x201d; white slip-on flats from DSW that I barely wear because white shoes are a mofo to keep clean.<br><br> � When I started my period while on a working vacation on Vieques Island and only had two pads, I called Olga, my hotel&#x2019;s concierge, and she told me they only had tampons, which I&#x2019;ve never used because I&#x2019;m scared of getting toxic shock syndrome after leaving the tamp-tamp inside me for too long. Anyway, she offered to call me a cab to take me to a convenience store about fifteen minutes away. I hard-passed on this suggestion and thought to myself, <i>Well, I guess I&#x2019;ll give this free-bleed thing a spin.</i> Free bleeding is generally considered a feminist move, but in my case, it was just unbridled laziness. I didn&#x2019;t feel like going through the trouble of putting on pants, which makes me wonder: Is this what parenthood is? Something inconvenient happens with your kid and you must fight all urges to be like, &#x201c;Peace out, dawg,&#x201d; and instead help them? Like if my kid came to me and said, &#x201c;Mom, I need new shoes for school and the mall closes in thirty minutes,&#x201d; I can&#x2019;t respond with, &#x201c;Okay, but I need to read this <i>InStyle </i>magazine profile about some white lady in Marrakesh&#x2014;YOU KNOW, A PLACE I CAN&#x2019;T AFFORD TO VISIT BECAUSE I HAD YOUR ASS&#x2014;doing a fashion diary and posing next to elephants that are like, &#x2018;Bish, why you have that goofy AF smile on your face when the back of my knees are like ashy celery?&#x2019;&#x201d; Point is, because I didn&#x2019;t want to leave my hotel room, I free-bled for two days, which were my super light days, so it was less a typical menstruation sitch and more like a few drops from a glass of V8 Splash spilling on a kitchen counter. Then on day three, I called Olga, she gave me one from her personal stash, and I went to the convenience store.<br><br> � THE FACT THAT I MADE THAT STUPID &#x201c;SPRAY AND PRAY&#x201d; SEX COMMENT WHEN I KNOW MY PARENTS ARE GOING TO READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS HOPING THE JOKE WOULD MAKE READERS LAF (TYPO, BUT I&#x2019;M LEAVING IT, THUS MAKING THIS TRASH WITHIN TRASH. #INCEPTION).<br><br> See?

This may sound daunting to some, but making your own products is one of the most empowering ways to take your beauty and health into your own hands. Just because the beauty products in stores contain tons of ingredients with extremely long and complicated names doesn&#x2019;t make all those chemicals necessary&#x2014;don&#x2019;t let them overwhelm you. Making beauty products is a lot easier than you&#x2019;d think.</p><p>Some of those ingredients can even be harmful.

I speak from experience.</p><p>After moving to New York from Texas, my skin had never looked worse. Stress, change of climate, change of water, pollution and who knows what else were clearly taking their toll, and my skin exacted its revenge with tons of huge, angry, inflamed zits. Of course, my first course of action was to evaluate my diet, up my water intake and be sure to be active and sleep well, but then I took a look at what I was putting on my skin. After some research I discovered my ordinary store-bought cleanser was mostly petroleum-based, preservative-filled garbage. I began researching more natural brands, and as I did that, I realized a lot of their active and most effective ingredients were those found in my kitchen. As a makeup artist and beauty addict, I&#x2019;d always been interested in skin care, but once I embarked upon my natural skincare sleuthing, my interest turned to an obsession.</p><p>For my imbalanced, acned condition, a friend suggested I use raw apple cider vinegar as a toner after cleansing. I began seeing drastic improvement in my complexion, and started trusting all-natural ingredients to care for my skin. I also began using tea tree oil to zap away zits, and a lemon and honey concoction to decongest my pores (you can find the recipe for that in the Detoxifying section of the Skin chapter!). Day by day my skin was improving and eventually returned to a state of homeostasis.</p><p>I began to wonder what natural ingredients could do for my dry hair and body. Natural oils, fruits, yogurt and a number of other items found in my very own kitchen did a fantastic job of nourishing and hydrating my hair and skin. At this point I was hooked on educating myself about, and randomly slathering on, all types of edible ingredients.</p><p></p></p><h2>Hand-in-Hand: Ceramics, Mosaics, Tapestries, and Wood Carvings by the California Mid-Century Designers Evelyn and Jerome Ackerman</h2><p><br>Hand-In-Hand: Ceramics, Tapestries, Wood Carvings, and Hardware by the California Mid-Century Designers Evelyn &amp; Jerome Ackerman is the first monograph of the artists whose oeuvre was critically influential and is now seen as the epitome of California mid-century modernism.

Structuralism constituted an intellectual revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and radically transformed the way philosophy, political and social theory, history, science, and aesthetics were discussed and thought about. For Marx was a key contribution to that process and it fundamentally recast the way in which many people understood Marx and Marxism.<br><br>This book contains the classic statements of Althusser&#x2019;s analysis of the young Marx and the importance of Feuerbach during this formative period, of his thesis of the &#x201c;epistomological break&#x201d; between the early and the late Marx, and of his conception of dialectics, contradiction and &#x201c;overdetermination.&#x201d; Also included is a study of the materialist theater of Bertolazzi and Brecht and the critique of humanist readings of Marxism. Since his death in 1990, Althusser&#x2019;s legacy has come under renewed examination and it is increasingly recognized that the influence of his ideas has been wider and deeper than previously thought: reading For Marx, in its audacity, originality and rigor, will explain why this impact was so significant.</p><p><b>Louis Althusser</b> was born in Algeria in 1918 and died in France in 1990.

Her <i>Volcano: The Eruption and Healing of St. Helens</i> was a Newbery Honor Book. She lives with her husband and two cats, Beemer and MeToo, in New Canaan, Connecticut.Grade 4-8 After the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, a number of fine books for young readers appeared which discussed at length this catastrophe, the devastation it created, and the geologic forces which caused it. Although providing less detail in these areas, Lauber brings the other titles up-to-date by describing the biological succession and geological changes which have since occurred at Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This provides an excellent example of the interdependence of all plant and animal life. How the Earth itself creates new environments for living things which in turn reshape the Earth is demonstrated visually as well as verbally. The captioned high-quality color photographs are well-integrated with the text, superbly illustrating the written material. This volume is more suited to younger readers than the Aylesworths' The Mount St. Helens Disaster (Watts, 1983) and Goldner's Why Mount Saint Helens Blew Its Top (Dillon, 1981), and is more current.

The book&#x2019;s ten chapters examine the key themes in contemporary art&#x2015;portraiture in the age of face transplants and facial recognition software, political activism, science, and religion, to name a few&#x2015;by artists including Jeff Koons, Louise Bourgeois, Damien Hirst, George Condo, Marlene Dumas, Sean Scully, Cindy Sherman, Banksy, Ai Weiwei, Antony Gormley, Christo and Jean-Claude, Jenny Holzer, Chuck Close, and Cornelia Parker. A chapter-length timeline at the end of the book traces the evolution of art from 1989 to today by closely examining one key artwork from each year.<br><br> Illustrated with the work of over 200 key artists, <em>Art Since 1989</em> is a lucid and engaging look at what may prove to be one of the more tempestuous eras in human history, if not the history of art. 254 illustrations</p><p>Kelly Grovier is a poet, historian, and cultural critic. He is a regular contributor on art to the Times Literary Supplement, and his writing has appeared in numerous publications, including the Observer, Sunday Times, and Wired. Educated at the University of California, Los Angeles, and at the University of Oxford, he is the author of 100 Works of Art That Will Define Our Age and Art Since 1989.</p><h2>The Shaping Forces in Music: An Inquiry into the Nature of Harmony, Melody, Counterpoint and Form (The Dover Series of Study Editions, Chamber Music, Orchestral Works, Operas in Full Score)</h2><p><p>A masterful and original classical composer as well as a renowned composer of film scores, Ernst Toch (1887&#x2013;1964) made a permanent contribution to music in this important and widely praised book. Based on a series of lectures given at Harvard in 1944 and first published in 1948, this book is a brilliant examination of the materials and concepts that are the basic building blocks of music &#x2014; harmony, melody, counterpoint, and form.<br>An admirable reconciliation of traditional and modern (mainly 12-tone) trends in composition, this book shows all types of writing must respond to psychological wants of the listener and how similar goals may be achieved in seemingly opposed styles. Illustrating his discussion with 390 musical examples, Toch not only introduces new ideas and approaches, but examines many age-old problems with clarity and precision &#x2014; consonance and dissonance, form versus number, and more. His analysis of the expanding harmonic universe, the wave line of melody, and the formative influence of movement are particularly penetrating.<br>New to this edition are a biological introduction by Toch's grandson, Lawrence Weschler; a previously unpublished letter from Thomas Mann to Toch about this book (in English translation); and a complete checklist of Toch's compositions. Intended for all those who have a minimum understanding of musical notation and theory, this book will appeal to music lovers, practical musicians and amateurs, and incipient composers.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Hart Crane: Complete Poems &amp; Selected Letters (LOA #168) (Library of America)</h2><p>No American poet has so swiftly and decisively transformed the course of poetry as Hart Crane. In his haunted, brief life, Crane fashioned a distinctively modern idiom that fused the ornate rhetoric of the Elizabethans, the ecstatic enigmas of Rimbaud, and the prophetic utterances and cosmic sympathy of Whitman, in a quest for wholeness and healing in what he called &#x201c;the broken world.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>White Buildings</i>, perhaps the greatest debut volume in American poetry since&nbsp;<i>Leaves of Grass</i>, is but an exquisite prelude to Crane&#x2019;s masterpiece&nbsp;<i>The Bridge</i>, his magnificent evocation of America from Columbus to the Jazz Age that countered the pessimism of Eliot&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Waste Land</i>&nbsp;and became a crucial influence on poets whose impact continues to this day.<br><br> This edition is the largest collection of Crane&#x2019;s writings ever published. Gathered here are the complete poems and published prose, along with a generous selection of Crane&#x2019;s letters, several of which have never before been published. In his letters Crane elucidates his aims as an artist and provides fascinating glosses on his poetry.<br><br> His voluminous correspondence also offers an intriguing glimpse into his complicated personality, as well as his tempestuous relationships with family, lovers, and writers such as Allen Tate, Waldo Frank, Yvor Winters, Jean Toomer, Marianne Moore, E. E. Cummings, William Carlos Williams, and Katherine Anne Porter. Several letters included here are published for the first time.<br><br> This landmark 850-page volume features a detailed and freshly-researched chronology of Crane&#x2019;s life as well as extensive explanatory notes, and over fifty biographical sketches of Crane&#x2019;s correspondents.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p><b>Hart Crane</b> (1899-1932), a pioneer of modernist poetry, is best known for brilliant debut <i>White Buildings </i>(1926) and his 1930 masterpiece, <i>The Bridge</i>.<i>Starred Review.</i> Crane's strenuous optimism about America, his barely coded celebrations of homoerotic desire and his bejeweled, dense, late Romantic language made him perhaps the most fiercely cherished of modernists, despite or because of his short, passionate and controversial life: Crane (1899&#x2013;1932) drowned in the Gulf of Mexico six years after completing his masterful long poem <i>The Bridge</i>. While Crane's best poems have long been widely known, drafts, fragments and apprentice work have been hard to find, and only in 1997 did a fully reliable selection from his voluminous, revealing correspondence appear. Hammer, who assembled that edition, knows more than anyone else alive about Crane; his hefty collection of all the verse, all the published prose (there isn't much) and much of that correspondence (nearly three-quarters of this book) instantly becomes the standard edition. Vigorous, sometimes hyperbolic letters trace Crane's move from Cleveland to New York, his pursuit of the poetic sublime, his interactions with other modernist luminaries (William Carlos Williams, Jean Toomer), his troubles with money, alcohol and family, and his peripatetic last years. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Former child star Dwayne has just been fired from his latest acting role and barely has enough money to get by after paying child support to his spiteful former lover, while Brick struggles to return to his uninspiring, white-collar job after suffering the dual blows of a health emergency and a nasty breakup with the woman he still loves. <br><br>Neither brother is looking to get entangled with a woman anytime soon, but love--and lust--has a way of twisting the best-laid plans. When Dwayne tries to reconnect with his teenaged son, he finds himself fighting to separate his animosity from his attraction for his son's mother, Frenchie. And Brick's latest source of income--chauffeur and bodyguard to three smart, independent women temporarily working as escorts in order to get back on their feet--opens a world of possibility in both love and money. Penny, Christiana, and Mocha Latte--a college student, Cuban refugee, and out-of-work engineer, respectively--know plenty of female johns who would pay top dollar for a few hours with a man like Brick . . . if he can let go of his past, embrace his unconventional new family, and allow strangers to become lovers. <br><br>Eric Jerome Dickey paints a powerful portrait of the family we have, the families we create, and every sexy moment in between.</p><p><b>Eric Jerome Dickey</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than twenty-five novels as well as a six-issue miniseries of graphic novels featuring Storm (<i>X-Men</i>) and the Black Panther.

Chant traditions from many cultures are being recognized today not only for their intrinsic beauty but also for their spiritual power. Paramahansa Yogananda, a pioneer in introducing India&#39;s art of devotional chanting to the West, explains how it helps to quiet and focus the mind in preparation for meditation.</p><p>Hailed as "the father of Yoga in the West", Paramahansa Yogananda - author of the spiritual classic <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> - is regarded as one of the great spiritual figures of our time. Born in India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.</p><h2>The Wild Wood</h2><p><p>A young artist returns to her cabin in the deep woods of Canada to concentrate on her illustrations.

There are many ways to consider this. One way is first to identify human power elements that are known to exist, but DO NOT receive societal nurturing, enhancement, training, scientific research, or philosophical interest.<br> <br> In-depth research will reveal at least five major categories of these power elements, one such category consisting of the aware powers innate in everyone of our species. The direct relationship between the spectrum of aware powers and increases of power is self-evident. The direct relationship between less or no awareness and less or no power is also self-evident.<br> <br> Most societal power structures do not encourage too much development of any aware and related powers, and, via societal programming of punishment, some structures force them into latency altogether. One basic reason is that too much awareness erodes the efficiency of walls of secrecy that support the elite of most power structures, whether large or small.<br> <br> Most are familiar with the awareness they have. But few are familiar with the awarenesses they don't have, but which anyway innately exist within their otherwise amazing information systems.</p></p><p></p><h2>Collected Later Poems</h2><p>R. S. Thomas (1913-2000) is one of the major poets of the twentieth-century, the greatest Welsh poet since Dylan Thomas, and one of the finest religious poets in the English language. This substantial gathering of his late poems shows us the final flowering of a truly great poet still writing at the height of his powers in his 70s and 80s. It begins with his autobiographical sequence, The Echoes Return Slow, unavailable for many years, and also includes, Counterpoint, Mass for Hard Times, No Truce With the Furies, and his final collection, Residues.</p><p>R.S. Thomas (1913-2000) is one of the major poets of our time, as well as one of the finest religious poets in the English language and Wales&#39;s greatest poet.&#39;Like Yeats, Thomas has produced his most powerful work in his old age - reminds me of Beethoven&#39;s last quartets in its fearless exploration of the mysteries of life and death - He is the first great poet since the Metaphysicals of the 17th century to draw his images from the science of his day&#39; - Denis Healey</p><h2>Eat Sleep Sit: My Year at Japan&#39;s Most Rigorous Zen Temple</h2><p>At the age of thirty, Kaoru Nonomura left his family, his girlfriend, and his job as a designer in Tokyo to undertake a year of ascetic training at Eiheiji, one of the most rigorous Zen training temples in Japan. This book is Nonomura's recollection of his experiences. He skillfully describes every aspect of training, including how to meditate, how to eat, how to wash, even how to use the toilet, in a way that is easy to understand no matter how familiar a reader is with Zen Buddhism. This first-person account also describes Nonomura's struggles in the face of beatings, hunger, exhaustion, fear, and loneliness, the comfort he draws from his friendships with the other trainees, and his quiet determination to give his life spiritual meaning.<br>After writing <i>Eat Sleep Sit</i>, Kaoru Nonomura returned to his normal life as a designer, but his book has maintained its popularity in Japan, selling more than 100,000 copies since its first printing in 1996. Beautifully written, and offering fascinating insight into a culture of hardships that few people could endure, this is a deeply personal story that will appeal to all those with an interest in Zen Buddhism, as well as to anyone seeking spiritual growth.</p><p>Born in 1959, <b>Kaoru Nonomura</b> traveled widely in Asia as a university student, and upon graduation began to work as a designer in Tokyo. At the age of thirty, he decided to put his career on hold to spend a year as a trainee monk at Eiheiji, a monastery famed for its rigid discipline. Twelve months later, he returned to his design job, and it was during his daily commute on a crowded train that he began to jot down his recollections of his Eiheiji experience. These notes eventually became <i>Eat Sleep Sit</i>, the author's only book."Here is an unusually fine translation of a most unusual best-seller. . . We sometimes have the odd idea that Zen means simply sitting around until satori happens. . . . It is much more, as novice Nonomura discovered when he joined the beginners at Eijeiji, one of the most rigorous temples in Japan. . . . a boot camp of a place that would make even brave marines quail. . . .Nonumura stood the strain. He stayed a year. . . . This painful route, then, is the true Zen path. . . . Almost as painful must have been the translation of this book with its extraordinary width of styles &#x2013; from the arcane Zen tracts of Dogen and others, to the diary-like grumbles of the clueless young Nonomura. Here, translator Juliet Carpenter not only stays the course, she defines it....here is a particularly felicitous translation, especially in the handling of the colloquial within the religious context." &#x2013;<b>DONALD RICHIE</b>, in <i>The Japan Times</i><br>"It is difficult to adequately praise this book. To begin with, Kaoru Nonomura is a great writer. The description of his experiences Is precise, detailed and unsparingly honest, yet giving sudden glimpses of the heart and soul of a poet and mystic. The translation is superb. The story is riveting. . . . a treasure for anyone on any spiritual path." &#x2013;<i> Light of Consciousness</i></p><h2>Unthinkable: An Extraordinary Journey Through the World&#39;s Strangest Brains</h2><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Nonfiction Book of the Month<br></strong><strong>Indiebound Bestseller </strong></p><p><strong>Award-winning science writer Helen Thomson unlocks the biggest mysteries of the human brain by examining nine extraordinary cases</strong></p><p>Our brains are far stranger than we think.

In a century of unrelenting, bloody warfare and religious persecution throughout Europe, Cromwell was, in many ways, a product of his times. As commander-in-chief of the army in Ireland, however, the responsibilities for the excesses of the military must be laid firmly at his door, while the harsh nature of the post-war settlement also bears his personal imprint. A warrior of Christ, somewhat like the crusaders of medieval Europe, he acted as God&#39;s executioner, convinced throughout the horrors of the legitimacy of his cause, and striving to build a better world for the chosen few.</p><p>Micheal O Siochru is a native of Dublin, lectures in history at Trinity College, Dublin and has written extensively on seventeenth-century Ireland.

In his novels, which have been called hypnotic,&#x201d; stunning,&#x201d; and exhilarating&#x201d; and earned him praise from the likes of Kurt Vonnegut and David Foster Wallace, Ann Beattie and Zadie Smith. Markson created his own personal genre. With crackling wit distilled into incantatory streams of thought on art, life, and death, Markson&#x2019;s work has delighted and astonished readers for decades.<br><br>Now for the first time, three of Markson&#x2019;s masterpieces are compiled into one page-turning volume: <i>This Is Not a Novel</i>, <i>Vanishing Point</i>, and <i>The Last Novel</i>. In <i>This Is Not a Novel</i>, readers meet an author, called only Writer,&#x201d; who is weary unto death of making up stories, and yet is determined to seduce the reader into turning pages and getting somewhere. <i>Vanishing Point</i> introduces us to Author,&#x201d; who sets out to transform shoeboxes crammed with note cards into a novel. In The Last Novel, we find an elderly author (referred to only as Novelist&#x201d;) who announces that, since this will be his final effort, he possesses carte blanche to do anything he damn well pleases.&#x201d;<br><br>United by their focus on the trials, calamities, absurdities and even tragedies of the creative life, these novels demonstrate David Markson&#x2019;s extraordinary intellectual richness leaving readers, time after time, with the most indisputably original of reading experiences.<br></p><p><b>David Markson</b>&#x2019;s other work includes <i>Wittgenstein&#x2019;s Mistress</i>, <i>Going Down</i>, and <i>Epitaph for a Tramp</i> &amp; <i>Epitaph for a Dead Beat</i> and <i>The Ballad of Dingus Magee</i>. Markson died in 2010.<br>Over the course of his career, Markson (Wittgenstein's Mistress; Reader's Block; etc.) has garnered high praise for his erudite, complex texts that challenge notions of genre. He continues to push against the boundaries of fiction with his latest, which echoes the titles of both Magritte's well-known painting of a pipe and a story by Diderot. Lacking plot or characters, this darkly humorous assemblage resembles a commonplace book or a notebook, such as Coleridge's or Emerson's, with entries noting odd facts, quotes and ideas. These entries averaging around 10 per page have the air of memoranda pointing to some future, more fully realized passage that might never materialize. Occasional appearances by someone called Writer ("Not being a character but the author, here") add a note of self-consciousness, reminding us of the performative nature of any work of art. Themes soon emerge: illness, art, fame and hygiene are obvious preoccupations. The entries lead us down the page, maintaining a brisk momentum. There are deaths (Pound of a blocked intestine, Manet of tertiary syphilis), quotations and seemingly out-of-context questions although it is apparent that context is rather beside the point. These references imply some ad hoc, interior encyclopedia: "The legend that as a young man Leonardo was so strong he could straighten a horseshoe with his bare hands." It is best to take Markson at his word and read this not as a novel but as some jester cousin to Pound's Cantos notations that gradually cohere in an underlying progress, a drift toward the momentary reconciliation of art, intellect and mortality. (Apr. 1)Forecast: Markson is at once unpredictable and reliable, to which the inclusion of blurbs from Ann Beattie and David Foster Wallace attests. This book won't appeal for most general fiction readers, but admirers of the author will seek out and savor his latest. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Mission Flats: A Novel</h2><p><b>Before the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling success of <i>Defending Jacob,</i> William Landay wrote this critically acclaimed first novel of crime and suspense&#x2014;perfect for fans of John Grisham, Scott Turow, and Dennis Lehane.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;Landay writes with eloquent intensity.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>By a shimmering lake in western Maine, a body lies sprawled in a deserted cabin.

Butler offers a brilliant reworking of the body, examining how the power of heterosexual hegemony forms the "matter" of bodies, sex, and gender. Butler argues that power operates to constrain sex from the start, delimiting what counts as a viable sex. She clarifies the notion of "performativity" introduced in Gender Trouble and via bold readings of Plato, Irigaray, Lacan, and Freud explores the meaning of a citational politics. She also draws on documentary and literature with compelling interpretations of the film <em>Paris is Burning</em>, Nella Larsen's <em>Passing</em>, and short stories by Willa Cather.</p></p><p>Bodies that Matter is a brilliant and original analysis. Butler&#39;s argumentation is rigorous and her insights always new and challenging.

Grounded in the wisdom and evidence of well-honed interpersonal social work skills...Donna Hardina's new text takes community practice to a higher level than ever before developed in book form; indeed she displays the most thorough understanding of research on community practice that I have read in any community practice text."--<b>Journal of Teaching in Social Work</b></p> <p>Community organization has been a major component of social work practice since the late 19th century. It requires a diverse set of abilities, interpersonal skills being among the most important. This textbook describes the essential interpersonal skills that social workers need in community practice and helps students cultivate them. Drawing from empirical literature on community social work practice and the author's own experience working with community organizers, the book focuses on developing the macro-level skills that are especially useful for community organizing. It covers relationship-building, interviewing, recruitment, community assessment, facilitating group decision-making and task planning, creating successful interventions, working with organizations, and program evaluation, along with examples of specific applications. </p> <p>For clarity and ease of use, the author employs a framework drawn from a variety of community practice models, including social action and social planning, transformative/popular education and community development approaches, and multicultural and feminist approaches. The text is linked to the competencies outlined in the Council of Social Work Education's (2008) Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS), as well as ethics and values identified in the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW) Code of Ethics, and the International Federation of Social Workers' statement of ethical principles. Most chapters begin with a quote from a community organizer explaining how interpersonal skills are used in practice, and student exercises conclude each chapter.

Allen and Cowling start with the simple "prokaryotic" cell--cells with no nucleus--and show how the bodies of more complex plants and animals consist of billions of "eukaryotic" cells, of varying kinds, adapted to fill different roles--red blood cells, muscle cells, branched neurons. The authors also show that each cell is an astonishingly complex chemical factory, the activities of which we have only begun to unravel in the past fifty years.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terence Allen</strong> does research in Cell Structure and Function at the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital Manchester. <strong>Graham Cowling</strong> has been director and teacher at the Medical School, University of Manchester.<br></p><h2>Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud</h2><p>In a time of dazzling scientific progress, how can we separate genuine breakthroughs from the noisy gaggle of false claims? From Deepak Chopra's "quantum alternative to growing old" to unwarranted hype surrounding the International Space Station, Robert Park leads us down the back alleys of fringe science, through the gleaming corridors of Washington power and even into our evolutionary past to search out the origins of voodoo science. Along the way, he offers simple and engaging science lessons, proving that you don't have to be a scientist to spot the fraudulent science that swirls around us.<br> While remaining highly humorous, this hard-hitting account also tallies the cost: the billions spent on worthless therapies, the tax dollars squandered on government projects that are doomed to fail, the investors bilked by schemes that violate the most fundamental laws of nature. But the greatest cost is human: fear of imaginary dangers, reliance on magical cures, and above all, a mistaken view of how the world works.<br> To expose the forces that sustain voodoo science, Park examines the role of the media, the courts, bureaucrats and politicians, as well as the scientific community. Scientists argue that the cure is to raise general scientific literacy. But what exactly should a scientifically literate society know? Park argues that the public does not need a specific knowledge of science so much as a scientific world view--an understanding that we live in an orderly universe governed by natural laws that cannot be circumvented.<br></p><p>Scientific error, says Robert Park, "has a way of evolving ... from self-delusion to fraud. I use the term voodoo science to cover them all: pathological science, junk science, pseudoscience, and fraudulent science." In pathological science, scientists fool themselves. Junk science refers to scientists who use their expertise to befuddle and mislead others (usually juries or lawmakers). Pseudoscience has the trappings of science without any evidence. Fraudulent science is, well, fraud--old-fashioned lying.<p> Park is well-acquainted with voodoo science in all its forms. Since 1982, he has headed the Washington, D.C., office of the American Physical Society, and he has carried the flag for scientific rationality through cold fusion, homeopathy, "Star Wars," quantum healing, and sundry attempts to repeal the laws of thermodynamics. Park shows why a "disproportionate share of the science seen by the public is flawed" (because shaky science is more likely to skip past peer review and head straight for the media), and he gives a good tour of recent highlights in <i>Voodoo</i>. He has a rare ability to poke holes compassionately, without excoriating those taken in by their fondest wishes. Park is less forgiving of scientists (especially Edward Teller) when he thinks they've fallen down on the job, a job that should include helping the public separate the scientific wheat from the voodoo chaff. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><br><strong>Robert L.

With three added chapters and a new preface summarizing our progress in the area of pain management, this is a must-hve for those in palliative medicine and hospice care.<br><br>The obligation of physicians to relieve human suffering stretches back into antiquity. But what exactly, is suffering? One patient with metastic cancer of the stomach, from which he knew he would shortly die, said he was not suffering. Another, someone who had been operated on for a mior problem--in little pain and not seemingly distressed--said that even coming into the hospital had been a source of pain and not suffering. With such varied responses to the problem of suffering, inevitable questions arise. Is it the doctor's responsibility to treat the disease or the patient? And what is the relationship between suffering and the goals of medicine?<br><br>According to Dr. Eric Cassell, these are crucial questions, but unfortunately, have remained only queries void of adequate solutions. It is time for the sick person, Cassell believes, to be not merely an important concern for physicians but the central focus of medicine. With this in mind, Cassell argues for an understanding of <em>what</em> changes should be made in order to successfully treat the sick while alleviating suffering, and how to actually go about making these changes with the methods and training techniques firmly rooted in the doctor's relationship with the patient. <br><br>Dr. Cassell offers an incisive critique of the approach of modern medicine. Drawing on a number of evocative patient narratives, he writes that the goal of medicine must be to treat an individual's suffering, and not just the disease. In addition, Cassell's thoughtful and incisive argument will appeal to psychologists and psychiatrists interested in the nature of pain and suffering.<br></p><p>Eric J. Cassell is at Cornell University Medical College.Cassell&#39;s arguments and discussions are clear and logical and his style makes it a pleasure to read. It is also clinically practical, with many case histories used to introduce and illustrate the discussion. Highly recommended. * IAHPC Website * [The author&#39;s] position is humane and compassionate and willing to address that which scares many clinicians - uncertainty and imperfection. I highly recommend this thorough and thoughtful book to anyone who grapples with the problem of human suffering in the midst of illness. * Palliative Medicine, 18 *</p><h2>Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy</h2><p>If you wanted to build a machine that would distribute propaganda to millions of people, distract them from important issues, energize hatred and bigotry, erode social trust, undermine respectable journalism, foster doubts about science, and engage in massive surveillance all at once, you would make something a lot like Facebook. Of course, none of that was part of the plan. In this fully updated paperback edition of <em>Antisocial Media</em>, Siva Vaidhyanathan explains how Facebook devolved from an innocent social site hacked together by Harvard students into a force that, while it may make personal life just a little more pleasurable, makes democracy a lot more challenging. It's an account of the hubris of good intentions, a missionary spirit, and an ideology that sees computer code as the universal solvent for all human problems. And it's an indictment of how "social media" has fostered the deterioration of democratic culture around the world, from facilitating Russian meddling in support of Trump's election to the exploitation of the platform by murderous authoritarians in Burma and the Philippines. Both authoritative and trenchant,<em> Antisocial Media</em> shows how Facebook's mission went so wrong.<br></p><p><br><strong>Siva Vaidhyanathan</strong> is the Robertson Professor of Media Studies and the Director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. He produces a local public-affairs television program and several podcasts, and he directs the publication of <em>Virginia Quarterly Review.</em> A former professional journalist, he has published five previous books on technology, law, and society, including<em> The Googlization of Everything</em>. He has also contributed to publications such as <em>The Nation</em>, <em>Slate</em>, <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, <em>The Washington Pos</em>t, <em>BookForum</em>, <em>The New York Times</em> <em>Book</em> <em>Review</em>, and <em>The Baffle</em>r.<br><br>"Fortunately, finally, we seem ready to have the necessary conversations about how social media has changed our hearts and minds and politics, including the hard conversations. And this is the right book for our moment. It lays out, in crisp, compelling language, why Facebook may be good for some individuals but not good for democracy. <em>Antisocial Media</em> is not negative or defeatist. But it does not sugarcoat the facts. We can only remake technology to conform to new social values if we do the hard work of committing to what they are. That's a problem that Facebook can't solve. This is history, philosophy, and a call to action." -Sherry Turkle, Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology, MIT, and author of <em>Reclaiming Conversation</em> and <em>Alone Together</em> <br><p></p><br>"Hello, reader. Do you use Facebook? Do you see it more times in a given day than you, say, drink a glass of water? If so, I suggest you find out from Siva Vaidhyanathan to what it is that you've given not only yourself, but also your crucial little portion of our world. He's the one who can tell you." -Jonathan Lethem, author of <em>Motherless Brooklyn</em> and <em>Fortress of Solitude</em> <br><p></p><br>"As a San Franciscan, I've had a front-row seat for the rise of Silicon Valley as a global power, and what the glossy new oligarchs have brought us terrifies me, as has the widespread obliviousness to the consequences of their new systems of information control. It's made me enormously grateful for Siva Vaidhyanathan, who set out after the election to dissect exactly how Facebook had helped corrupt our minds, our culture, our elections, and our governments. His scathing conclusions here should both chill you and equip you to face the perils the new information megacorporations pose to each and all of us." -Rebecca Solnit, author of <em>Hope in the Dark</em> <br><p></p><br>"An eye -opening and provocative examination of the unintended consequences that this tech giant inflicted on the global community it created." --Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Elizabeth Ware Packard Professor of Communication, Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania, and author of <em>Cyberwar</em> <br><p></p><br>"Facebook's plan to connect the world has backfired. Democratic societies are unraveling everywhere. Conflict is trumping community, suspicion is undermining trust. Antisocial Media is the best account of how and why the world's leading tech firms have contributed to this crisis, here and across the globe. Vaidhyanathan's message is not merely necessary; it's urgent." --Eric Klinenberg, Professor of Sociology at NYU and author of <em>Palaces for the People: How Social Infrastructure Can Help Fight Inequality, Polarization, and the Decline of Civic Life</em> <br><p></p><br>"Vaidhyanathan does have some solutions in mind, but they are not the simple tweaks Facebook proposes. There's no way at this point to reengineer a platform that rewards hasty, emotional, shallow engagement or moderates content to ensure two billion people behave themselves. We need to work across borders to make these steps multinational if not global. And we need to do it soon. The lamps are going out all over Europe again, and far beyond." -- Barbara Fister, <em>Inside HigherEd</em> <br><p></p><br>"In <em>"Antisocial Media,"</em> University of Virginia professor Siva Vaidhyanathan gives a full and rigorous accounting of Facebook's sins. Much of the criticism will be familiar to anyone who has been following the news about the company. What distinguishes the book is Vaidhyanathan's skill in putting the social media phenomenon into a broader context - legal, historical and political." -- Nicholas Carr, <em>The Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"In a post-Cambridge Analytica, post-Donald Trump election world, Vaidhyanathan's book <em>[Antisocial Media]</em> is a critique of the "Facebook machine" and the ways it operates on users in terms of "pleasure, surveillance, attention, protest, politics, and disinformation." - <em>Express Newspaper Service, The</em> <em>Indian Express</em><p></p><br>"Vaidhyanathan has written a structured response to the behemoth that is Facebook. He acknowledges all the rhetorically valid ways in which Facebook might offer emotionally fulfilling interactions (the author himself is a user), but he buttresses these emotive motivations with close readings of the filter bubble, monetization of all transactions on the platform, and even the inherent vice of "good" business... Verdict: Ideal for readers who live in the world of social media who want to put these platforms into context." --Jesse A. Lambertson, <em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"An excellent critique of the social media giant underlines the threat it poses to us all - and suggests how it can be tamed. -- John Naughton, <em>The Guardian</em> <br><p></p><br>"With 30 per cent of the world's population on Facebook, Vaidhyanathan contends that the platform could become the operating system of our lives. And while it's fun to catch up with old school friends, its "mediated cacophony" is a powerful tool for the vocal minority to quickly subvert silent majorities. Zuckerberg himself is curiously complacent. Facebook, he says, "is just too big to govern. We are victims of its success." -- Nick Smith, <em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em> <br><p></p><br>"This thoroughly researched and persuasively argued account of social media's noxious effects on the very fabric of society is the first study of its kind: a trenchant analysis of Facebook's unwholesome side effects. It needed saying, and it's supremely well said." - Juanita Coulson, <em>The Lady</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Film Art: An Introduction</h2><p>Film is an art form with a language and an aesthetic all its own.

These three centuries, known to us as the Hellenistic Age, witnessed a vast expansion of Greek civilization eastwards, following Alexander's conquests; and later, Greek civilization penetrated deeply into the western Mediterranean world assisted by the political conquerors of Greece, the Romans. But philosophy throughout this time remained a predominantly Greek activity. The most influential thinkers in the Hellenistic world were Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics. This book gives a concise critical analysis of their ideas and their methods of thought.&nbsp;The last book in English to cover this ground was written sixty years ago. In the interval the subject has moved on, quite rapidly since the last war, but most of the best work is highly specialized. There is a clear need for a general appraisal of Hellenistic philosophy which can provide those who are not specialists with an up-to-date account of the subject. Hellenistic philosophy is often regarded as a dull product of second-rate thinkers who are unable to stand comparison with Plato and Aristotle. This book will help to remove such misconceptions and arouse wider interest in a field which is fascinating both historically and conceptually.</p><p>"A scholarly but readable account of Epicureanism, Scepticism and Stoicism . . . beautifully lucid."--<i>Greece and Rome</i>&nbsp;"Fulfills a long-felt need for an up-to-date general appraisal ."--<i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>&nbsp;"The best general introduction to the subject now available."--<i>Philosophical Quarterly</i>&nbsp;"Remarkably successful . . . a most welcome and accomplished book."&nbsp;--<i>Classical Review</i>The purpose of this book is to trace the main development in Greek philosophy during the period which runs from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. to the end of the Roman Republic (31 B.C.).</p><h2>Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System for Infants and Children (AEPS�), Test: Birth to Three Years and Three to Six Years (AEPS: Assessment, Evalutaion, and Programming System (Unnumbered))</h2><p>The <b>AEPS� Test</b> allows professionals to gather assessment data for one child or a group of children in home- or center-based settings.

Each item is scored with a 0 (does not pass), 1 (inconsistent performance), or 2 (passes consistently). To supplement and clarify these scores, professionals choose from 5 qualifying notes and use the blank space provided for more specific comments. With this multipart scoring process&#x2014;and the input caregivers add with the revised Family Report&#x2014;the <b>AEPS Test</b> lets professionals pinpoint what children can do, identify areas that need attention, and use that information as a starting point to develop individualized IFSP/IEP goals and objectives.</p><p> This volume is part of the bestselling <b>AEPS</b> system for children from birth to six years who have disabilities or are at risk for developmental delays.

What is the relationship between the financial system and the price of land? In this accessible but provocative guide to the economics of land and housing, the authors reveal how many of the key challenges facing modern economies, including housing crises, financial instability, and growing inequalities, are intimately tied to the land economy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking at the ways in which discussions of land have been routinely excluded from both housing policy and economic theory, <i>Rethinking the Economics of Land and Housing </i>argues that in order to tackle these increasingly pressing issues a major re-thinking by both politicians and economists is required. This is the first comprehensive guide to the role of land in the economy, making this an essential reference for students, scholars, policymakers, activists, and NGOs working on land issues.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Josh Ryan-Collins</b> is senior economist at the New Economics Foundation, as well as a visiting research fellow at the University of Southampton Business School. <b>Toby</b><b>Lloyd</b> is head of housing development at Shelter, a charity that campaigns to end homelessness in the UK. <b>Laurie</b><b>Macfarlane</b> is an economist at the New Economics Foundation.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;A lucid and convincing explanation of why a free-market approach to the land problem makes little sense; why the state needs to intervene; and of the wide range of policy options available.

It provides a powerful critique of the UK&#x2019;s failed policies towards land and housing and it sets out an ambitious but credible set of alternatives which merit serious debate.

At the end, when the authors get to recommendations, you may be taken&nbsp;aback by some of the things they have in mind. But that's all the more reason to read the book. . . . [I]t is the book that did the most to alter my perception of the world.&#x201d; (Must-Reads of 2017 <i>Bloomberg</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Land policy is the missing issue in any discussion on planning, development, and the property market.

This timely book synthesizes new research and its implications for practice that is critical for professionals working with Latinos in educational and counseling contexts. <br><br>The authors provide insight into identity development, environmental influences, and how these factors influence persistence in higher education. By using a synthesis approach to organize multiple studies around how being Latinx influences the experiences of students in college and beyond, the authors offer a holistic view of the Latino population. <br><br>Each chapter uses mixed method data points to highlight the experiences of this growing population and provide helpful insights for those who work with Latinx individuals within higher education and community settings. The new Lifespan Model of Latinx Ethnic Identity Development constitutes a framework to consider the development and tensions experienced by Latinos as they engage with the various cultures represented within U.S. society. The studies presented in this book provide an evidence-based understanding how environmental differences may produce differing levels of development for college students and how change in environments produce reflective refinement of adult Latinx identity. <br><br>Practitioners will learn about practices that help Latinx college students. Faculty and researchers will gain new understandings of the Latinx experience, and discover a starting point for further reflection and investigation.</p><p>Vasti Torres is a Professor in the Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education (CSHPE) and an Associate Faculty member of Latina/o Studies at University of Michigan.<br><br>Ebelia Hernandez is an Associate Professor at the Graduate School of Education, Rutgers University.<br><br>Sylvia Martinez is an Associate Professor, Educational Leadership and Policy Studies and Latino Studies at Indiana University, Bloomington.<br><br>Sarita E.

Our nation is in desperate need of a diverse highly educated workforce. By 2060 more than 25% of the total US population will be Latino/a and our school systems across the country are already Hispanic Serving Districts. Thus, it is imperative that we understand the students we serve and provide them the tools necessary to succeed. This book is essential if we are to indeed educate the future of our nation."</p> (Mildred Garc�a, President <i>American Association of State Colleges and Universities</i>)<br><br><p>"This book is important for policymakers and campus administrators in defying the all too easy overgeneralizations of groups that result in poor policies and practices. Not only are Latinx a diverse groups from many different cultural backgrounds, but from many different economic circumstances, family backgrounds and expectations, communities, and academic experiences. One student may thrive in a Hispanic serving institution while another may not, some may appreciate proactive advising and others may be turned off, and some may feel a need to belong on campus while others aspire to continue to be part of their home community. And these differences reflect unique and multifaceted identities that are important for and shape learning and development &#x2013; our core mission. This is a must read for those who want to develop well informed policies or be quality educators."</p> (Adrianna Kezar, Dean&#x2019;s Professor of Leadership and Director of the Pullias Center for Higher Education <i>University of Southern California</i>)<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><p>"With a foreword by Brown and Santiago, co-founders of <i>Excelencia</i> in Educaction, and written in accessible language, <i>Understanding the Latinx Experience: Developmental and Contextual Influences</i> is a good resource for leaders, staff, and faculty to become aware of the experiences of Latinx students in higher education. They will find concrete examples and recommendations about how to improve the Latinx college experience, and, in turn, student success.</p><p>One strength of this book is the solid research included. Longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data support the authors&#x2019; model by using Latinx voices that represent the heterogenous ways of being Latinx and experiencing higher education. The qualitative part of the research design offers clear examples of the complex lives of Latinx college students. Here, the reader will find &#x201c;insight into how the students themselves see their experiences&#x201d; (p. 12).<br></p><p> </p> <table><tbody><tr><td><p><i>Understanding the Latinx Experience: Developmental and Contextual Influences</i> provides a timely insight into the identity development of the Latinx student population. The book provides useful information for institutions to improve Latinx student success and illuminates what we can do to retain and graduate more Latinx students from universities. Higher education professionals, institutions, and policymakers will be better informed about the factors influencing college persistence by reading the students&#x2019; stories and college experiences throughout the book. The book is an invaluable resource for all professionals working with Latinx students."</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table> (Teachers College Record)</p><h2>Parenting with Grace, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Family therapist and parent Gregory Popcak and his wife, Lisa, are back with their second edition of <b>Parenting with Grace: The Catholic Parents' Guide to Raising <i>almost</i> Perfect Kids</b>.
